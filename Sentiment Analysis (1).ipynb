This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.\",\n",
       " \"Best game, more better than Sam Pepper's YouTube account. 10/10What you'll need to play:A computerSome extra pants.Pros:Scary as hell.Fun.Adventure.Spooky.Did I forgot to mention that its scary as hell?You'll get more pants/briefs in your wardrobe.Time consuming if you're bored.Cons:Buying pants/briefs. You haven't downloaded it yet.\",\n",

       " \"Somewhere between light hearted, happy parody and being afraid of the dark lies Spooky's House of Jump Scares. You are tasked with the daunting duty of surviving one thousand rooms in this endless first person perspective runner. Each room is no more than a few seconds thanks to a sprint key and the fact that each door counts as a new room. Even then one thousand rooms is still a feat against tedium and needless repetition. There are still things every fifteen or so rooms to keep your interest and at the end of fifty rooms you'll find a save point, but nothing can save you from permanent death at the hands of the foul creatures that live within.On the surface the game has a clean, chipper almost cartoon low budget charm to it. Jump scares are rare and at first it comes in the form of adorable cardboard cutouts of pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons that pop out of the wall accompanied by a sound. Some of the sounds are silly and unfitting other times its screeches to drive chills down your spine. The game excels in the sound department and makes good use of music, ambient sounds and foot steps following you.As you delve deeper through the doors of this dank dungeon, you'll uncover more frightening things and points of intreege. There are plenty of written notes here and there. A few times you'll need to search for a key in a different room, but the other ninety-nine percent of the game is leaving rooms behind forever.The themes of the rooms begin to change from the mundane almost Wolfenstien 3D-esque corridors to metal asylum rooms that give you a flashlight to find your way through. There are purple dungeons, green sewers with glowing scum. Some rooms are coated with slime to slow you own while others have holes in the ceiling as if to give you a feeling of dread that something could pop out.There are a limited amount of rooms and I started to memorize them all. Even the game's crescendo encounters in a vacant room with walkways. There's no way to fall into the dark chasms, it acts as if they were walls, but with this open room you get to see a specific creature that might be following you. Sometimes they can float over the gaps, other times they're stuck trying to walk at you from across the gap so you can get a good look at them when they're harmless.If they touch you three or so times you're dead. You have health that does replenish over time and these big moments are rare and easy to avoid. Just keep running and hope there are no locked doors! They only happen in specific rooms and sometimes the rooms are empty, but it still gives that dreadful feeling.You can tear through these rooms pretty quick about 350 of them in a 45 minute. Your stamina will deplete to give a monster the chance to catch you, but going through a door restores your will to run. Other than that waiting a few seconds will replenish your stamina. Longer rooms hav1e limited visibility. The further out an area is the darker it gets.A few rooms have good diversions or tricks to them. Such as one that turns bright and you need to enter the correct combination of corridors signaled by chimes until you can see the door. Another room is endless darkness with a torch at the end, until its revealed that the torch is merely painted on a black wall. A few times you'll need to search an adjacent room for a key to the one you're in.Every fifty rooms, you take a moment to unwind in an elevator that reminds you to hang in there or have a coffee break. The game makes a good balance of calm moments for each of the few tense situations. Its what keeps you off kilter and never expecting anything. Every two hundred and fifty rooms offers a prize to you. What's in the box? Is it snakes? Is it a jack-in-the-box or is it a note?Truth be told I'm very goal oriented with video games and so Spooky missed its mark for me. The cardboard cutouts get in the way. Being chased by something means that it was no threat since it was already behind me. Perhaps in later rooms it gets more difficult, but this is just easy tedium.  Another room, another room, another room. Then knowing I have seven hundred more rooms and another two hour investment of endless running turns the game into a grind. There's no fear and its too long to endure even with save points. The game reuses its points of interest a few times since it recycles rooms.Another issue I have with the game is getting stuck on edges where I need to push away from a wall to get free and turn a corner. Its more than walls, its on the gaps too. I suppose this is acceptable for a scary game where you get chased, but I'm hung up on these hang ups.One interesting thing the game does have is a stabbing mini game where it looks like you're a ghost in a mall. Its a good diversion from the repetition. There's even a computer that shows you all the creatures in the house. Well most of them at least.The best selling point this game has is that its free. By no means does that make this a good game, but it makes it easier to accept. Its a game that brings you up with charm to tear you down with scares beyond the cheap cardboard cutouts that can litter a hallway every so often. Its just far too repetitive without that much dread or excitement.\",\n",

But after your first real horror encounter you began to feel chased everywhere you go. And the cute jump scares are not cute anymore.

This is one of those delightful exceptions, even if that's because the cuteness at first is then outshone by genuinly horrible things hunting you.  The 'Jumpscares' in the title comes from cheerful little carnival haunted house-style, wooden, pop up monsters that will appear starting early on.  The real horrors are more of the 'you can't fight it, just learn how it moves and strikes, and try to get away'.  This does not, however, in any way mean the funhouse pop up monsters stop showing up; even if you got used to them before, you are quite likely to get a startle when one springs up in front of you while you're distracted fleeing some lurking abomination.\",\n",

       " \"Early Access ReviewAn interesting and quirky experience for me. Almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next, of which there are 1000, some short and straighforward, some longer and more complex, but all being a few seconds long at most. Occasionally, you'll be chased by monsters which, despite coming in many variations, almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit. Very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed, giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to. Because of these characteristics, the game feels like a very long chase sequence and, with 1000 rooms to be overcome before the game is over, it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game, clocking at around 3 hours for completion. Fortunately, there are save spots every 50 (later 100) rooms, which allows the player to take a break if necessary. Difficulty-wise, it's not hard; almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle, and it's entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms. However, the game leaves little room for error, as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one-hit kill you if they manage to get in close enough. It all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door. In regards to atmosphere, it's a blend of humor/cuteness with horror, which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots. The humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue, which are peppered throughout the gameplay (but become increasingly rarer). The horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds, most of them from the monsters that chase you, and I didn't find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor, so I believe the game was successful in its atmosphere. In my opinion, that is the highest point of this game - seeing what monsters, environments and dialogue will come next.All in all, if you're a fan of horror games, I'd say give this at least a try. It's different and has a charm to it that I believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique.\",\n",
       " \"Starts off rather harmless and cute, and very quickly takes a turn for dark and disturbing.

       " 'Spooky\\'s House of Jumpscares is a horror game, no sense beating around the bush. Although it pretends to be a mockery of games that rely on jumpscares for the first fifty or so rooms, things quickly take a turn for the sinister...The game is not long at all; going through the 1,000 rooms is not as tedious of a task as it seems, as each room can be ran through easily within 6 seconds, slightly more for \"special\" rooms.Gameplay is rather simple: Get to the end of Spooky\\'s maze, and survive whatever lies in the bowels of her home. New monsters are introduced every 75 rooms or so, and after the initial chase sequence, can begin chasing you again at any time through your perilious adventure, always keeping things tense. Special rooms and notes can be found throughout the mansion, hinting at a bigger picture behind Spooky and her house...There are two endings, giving you a reason to play through the story at least twice. If obtaining a high score is your cup of tea, you can try your luck in Endless Mode, which challenges you to go as far as possible into the mansion, with monsters, many new, many old, making an appearance.The DLC, Karamari Hospitial, adds even more horror, with a shorter campaign, five new monsters to avoid, and tons of little secrets to hunt down.I highly recommend this game. Also, check out the HD remaster if you like this game! It adds even more stuff to Spooky\\'s twisted home.',\n",
       " \"This little gem is absolutely pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly terrifying. How? I hear you cry. Surely because of the cutesy graphics it couldn't possibly be scary. Right? WRONG. DEAD WRONG. Ahem. The soft graphics are what the game uses to lull you into a false sense of security. After gaining your trust the game begins piling on the atmosphere like a dumptruck at a...dumptruck convention(?) After the first 50-100 rooms or so it becomes clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares aren't the only thing plagueing you as you journey through what quickly becomes a monstrous hellscape born out of your own nightmares. The game also nods and pays homage to most genres of horror and even references some popular horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil. The game isn't very long but if you're a coward like me then you'll only be able to play it in short, 200 room bursts.

       " \"Early Access ReviewSpooky's House of Jump Scares is worth your time. Being free (as of this review), this is the only benchmark the game has to pass. If it's worth your money, and worth your time, you should play it. While I have very little experience in the horror genre, Spooky's House of Jump Scares is pretty transparent with its premise. There's plenty of cute and lighthearted moments, some jump scares, and a thin thread of plot which goes deeper than the surface level. There are 1000 rooms, so you'll spend most of your time wandering from room to room, taking less than a second to move through one of the many repeated corridors. And, while the enemies are spaced out well enough to keep you interested, they can sometimes be a bit underwhelming. However, there are a couple of genuinely scary moments, and the game has enough charm that you may want to stick around to see it all.If you're looking for simple jump scares this game has you covered, and if you're interested in some horror game mechanics in a boiled-down scenario, check it out.\",\n",

       " 'I wouldn\\'t necesarily say I recomend this game fully. The gameplay is very basic, progression from going room to room gets old, and it\\'s not the most terrifying game to hardened horror fanatics. But, if you got some time to kill, it\\'s a fun distraction in short bursts.The game is very emersive. The ambience is very well done, the sound design alone really makes you feel like you\\'re trapped miles below ground in a endless maze. The humor is very entertaining and quirky, which is probably the strongest point of the game. The \"jumpscares\" in the name sake aren\\'t the main point of horror. Instead, they\\'re really kind of the joke of the game. When a real threat shows up, it actually doesn\\'t resort to jumpscares. And the monsters are varried enough to keep it suspensful when you\\'re locked in a chase.The only downside, once again, is that it can get old really fast. Basically you just walk room to room. Every now and then you\\'ll read some notes that parody the ones in other cliche horror games. And the jumpscares get more and more sillier. But, sometimes it can feel like a real chore to play this game during long periods. And I have no real interest to go back and find out how to get the good ending, nor do I really want to spend any money for the DLC. But, all in all, it\\'s kind of fun to switch on every now and then when I want something spooky, but not too spooky.',\n",

Surprisingly, it gives you the horror.I would definitely play this some more. Truth is though, I'm easily scared. So I keep rushing to the nearest door.

Hey, as a certain multi-holiday musical once told us \"Life\\'s no fun without a good scare\". So I tried it, and was not disappointed. The jump scares were so good I Noped out after the second \"Specimen\". I then promptly pulled a Lets Play video, because I desperately wanted to see the rest of the game. Now, I plan on going back and facing my fears, because I want to play through the rest.This game blends cutesy artwork and characters with horror in an amazing way.

       " 'Note: If you don\\'t want my long winded review and wish to see the pro\\'s/con\\'s of this game just scroll paste my wall of text. However if you want my personal experience feel free to read.Now I have little time with this game keep that noted however i\\'ve had enough time with it to do a proper review of first impressions. This game starts off as a fun joke with a few cute jump scares, however that mood quickly turns grim. This game does not succeed with it\\'s graphical appearance however the audio and ambience that you overhear quickly makes up for that. This game looks like it\\'s just something some company threw together however if you go into how the monster is announced or how they introduce the new concepts via different room layouts, it quickly makes up for it\\'s lack of looks with well polished audio as well as design. My first impressions of the game within the first 10 rooms was \"This is a joke of a game and dull already.\" That was until the audio started tugging at the back of my mind and then I paused for the first time with the most creative surprise I had in a while, it was Spooky casually smiling at you through the static of the screen. The reason I mention this is that it was a well done concept that I can honestly say caught me off guard. So all these little things that stick to the back of your mind as you\\'re going room by room pulled by curiosity leaves me to say that this game is definitely a great one. With it\\'s design and use of just a few simple concepts it makes for a good experience. The last thing i\\'ll mention that I liked that made it stand out from other \"horror\" games is that it right out introduces you the \"player\" as you dive into this house of horror. This makes for the fact that you directly are introduced, meaning there isn\\'t some dull protagonist that you\\'re hiding behind.Pros: 1:Audio/SFX is well polished and well used.2:Design is different than what i\\'ve encountered in the past as well as well thought.3:It slowly takes you deeper into the horror and leads to a climactic build up that was well done from my experience.4:Gives a nostalgic vibe with the room designs as well as environment.5:The game is Free to Play and a well done F2P game at that.Cons:1:Movement was quite odd and clunky at a few segments.2:Does not take kindly to players with a lower DPI 3:Textures were bland and reused makes for a dull expirience till the climax. However this minorly impacts the game.4:Lack of pull factors other than Spooky, and Curiosity and arguably the ambience.Mixed Factors:1:Voice acting was a double edged sword, on one hand it was cute and well presented on the other it wasn\\'t executed properly. I personally enjoyed it, but other\\'s could be turned away from the game with such a presentation.Overall Ratings:SFX/Audio 9/10Design 8/10Voice Acting 7/10Gameplay 6/10Character Introduction 8/10Graphic/Texture Rating 4/10Overal Rating 7.5/10(Keep in mind this is a F2P game)I know this rating doesn\\'t make it seem like a must play game. However for it being Free and so well designed it is worth a try at the very least. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends in a heartbeat. Keep in mind though that this game immerses you via it\\'s audio cues as well as it\\'s climactic build up. If these factors do not interest you or if you\\'re looking for a fast paced action game this is most likely not going to be something you will enjoy.',\n",

The game uses atmosphere to its advantage in an excellent way and after playing the game alone, I have seen stuff move such as my own shadow and flinch (true story). Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a great game to play with friends too as my friends would freak out when something happened on the laggy screen I cast onto which would make me smile as I was already in the next room. The only issue I have with the game is the screen moving downwards and to the left occasionally but it was easy to get past. I wish I could take screenshots to share with friends but print screen works just as well as a substitute. Definitely give the game a chance if you have the time since it's free.

Eventually sh*t starts getting creepy: \"things\" start chasing you and, as research lab databases show, there are tonnes of monsters to come the deeper you go. I loved the mini-games: a great relief from the game\\'s jump scares.Although I think jump scares are cheap, and far too many games use them and go on to tag them as a \"horror\" games (FNAF), this game uses them effectively: creating an eerie atmosphere and making you jump out of your chair at even the cutest cardboard cut-outs while being chased by a head-eating (Resident Evil-like) monster.This game has a strange effect as I want to continue on \"just one room more\" I tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor (which I nervously walk down) or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight(???) Worth the Â£000.00 I invested and I\\'m looking forward to the 1000th room (if I ever get there). Game-play: 8/10Helpless at the start.....and so far still like that.

According to the game's wiki this game has several bugs which end up killing your character (which wouldn't be so bad if I could save my game whenever I wanted but unfortunately I can only save my game every 50 rooms at particular locations).

Let's jump right to it then, shall we?In my Opinion is this Game quite enjoyable, at least if you don't try to not find it scary. Some Game Mechanics are pretty neat, as for example, the Fact that One can open Doors while walking backwards is something I'd like to see in more Games. I also appreciate CAT-DOS as Source of Background Information a great Deal.  But those are just small Details. I think what defines a Horror Game is the Atmosphere, and that is a very strong Point of this Title. Especially the Music is most of the Time on spot.The Enemy variety is okay for the Amount of Playtime and the the Graphics are pretty cute-ish when it comes to the Surroundings.I also might add that this Game has an pretty interesting Sense of Humor, which is normally not to be expected from a Horror Title. Which I personally can dig a great deal.As for my Part, I'll probably recommend 'Spooky's House of Jump Scares' to everybody who might have a Interest in Video Games of its kind.\",\n",

Every time you make it through 50 rooms you're greeted with a elavator which takes you down to the next floor below, where the whole ♥♥♥♥ing process starts all over again. its really boring. oh did i forget to mention the lame jumpscares that sound like my 2 year old sister being tickled?  Oh yeah, once every 100 floors has an enemy in which you just gotta run away from. That's most probably the only fun thing about this game.

Don\\'t be scared of the 1000 room bulletin. Every room is short and quick and your sprint refreshes everytime you enter a new room.  spoiler alert:[/you die in both endings]There is a good ending and a bad ending.

       " 'After seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,I wanted to make a review talking about what a GREAT horror game this is.First of all,it\\'s free.I really see no reason why you shouldn\\'t get it just to try it out.Karamari Hospital (The DLC) costs just under $6,but if you enjoyed the game I would recommend the dlc.Now,I\\'m gonna get into the main review.The game itself does have a lot of references,but that\\'s what makes it great.The game doesn\\'t feel like it \"stole\" these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references.1.If you find jump scares scary.GET THIS GAME.2.If you are unsure,try watching Markiplier or someone play it,that\\'s how I found out about it.Just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises.3.I found I rarely died from enemies,but that was because I was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn\\'t get near them.TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE ENEMIES!!(I won\\'t say them all,just some stuff to know)(Possible Spoilers)Specimen 1.The main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren\\'t scary,but later into the game,I began to fear them more then the actual enemies.They jump scare you,but the do it ALL the time,and it\\'s terrifying.Specimen 2 and 3 chase you around,they aren\\'t the scariest.I skipped a bit of the game,(I\\'m gonna replay it all soon),so I missed the specimen 4 and 5 parts.They still look spooky though.Specimen 6 is well...The bane of my existence.Specimen 6 is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.His death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of Zelda references,which I quite enjoyed.Just,when you play the game,BE READY FOR SPECIMEN 6.Specimen 7 isn\\'t really scary.But it confuses you,and makes chase\\'s with other monsters MUCH HARDER.Specimen 8 is the deer god.Things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then 8 shows up,and the terror begins.Although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.Specimen 9 randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.I have never encountered him before,[spoileri] He re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.It is fun,and similar to the Ganon battle from LOZ:OOC.[/spoileri] Specimen 10 is featured in a cool \\'futuristic\\' area.I don\\'t entirely remember him,but I remember he is VERY hard to run away from.Specimen 11,who I refer to as the \\'beef god\\',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.I remember him from let\\'s plays of the game,so maybe I was just nervous when I entered his area.The area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.There is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.Specimen 12 the \\'old man\\' or \\'the mansion\\' is one massive room.It takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the \\'old man\\'.It was very fun,and scary.Specimen 13 who I call \\'the siren\\' is a monster very similar to Kaernk from \\'Amnesia:The Dark Descent\\'.You must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.It was really fun,and the area before was very scary.That raps up the review of the monsters,but I have a few more things to say.1.The game doesn\\'t have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror.2.The game has A LOT OF REFERENCES,which is one of the best parts of the game.3.THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :3)I would definitely recommend this game.10/10  ',\n",

       " \"The only scary thing about this game is that the developers thought that slowly walking around opening doors with interjections of comically-horrendous jump scares every 10 minutes would somehow be playable. It's not.I originally played this game at a friend's, which meant I had to install the game on my own machine and play for 5 minutes in order to be eligible to write a review. I imagine the feeling is similar to that of visiting an uncle that abused you as a child. My non-masochistic nature screamed at me to stop, but I felt I had an obligation to bridge some of the unprecedented gap between the game's reviews and its quality.\",\n",
       " \"The game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring. Every 100 rooms (=1floor), there are generally 2 or 3 stuff happening, a big room (which is actually multiple rooms) with spooky stuff, a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor, and some notes left by some dude for you to read. Otherwise you're just walking through the same rooms over and over. Sometimes you think a room is important but it's actually just a regular room with nothing special. Oh and jump scares.But when you're not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas.Hopefully it's free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that you're wondering if you're not paying the game with your time.\",\n",

You would think with a name like House of Jump Scares that it would have too many, but no, it doesn't really have too much of anything except hallways. Kudos on the horror pop culture references, but I'm not sure who this game is for. Its too cute to be spooky and too dark to be cute.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewI have completed the game and got the bad ending.I've also gotten the other ending.This game starts out really terrifying, with the music and graphics. But it only gets worse, Monsters will start chasing you and sounds will creep you out. At points you are tested on various tasks of survival. There are many wonderful things I could talk about Spooky's. Specimen 4 is one of my favorite enemies in the entire game, the red bloody claws and calm behavior make her awesome.Spoiler warning:The late game really tests your patience and observance, stalkers, water monsters, long halls and very awkward corridors make the monsters who get faster later on more challenging. You will make mistakes ultimately leading to your death if you're not careful. Seriously! This game can get fairly challenging at points. I like it when games add challenge which the game lacked when it wasn't finished. The game is still fair once you know what you're doing. I also enjoyed the bad ending.Overall I find players may appreciate this game for what it is.\",\n",

Spooky\\'s House of Jump Scares is a indie 1st person walking simulator, you take on the role of an historian on an expedition to explore a strange castle. After this you\\'re given little to no explanation other than the odd notes found through the game. The game basically boils down to open door, proceed through room open next door. It gets old really, really fast. To keep things interesting, the game throws some new enemy types (which I honestly couldn\\'t tell apart from the others) and they spice things up with the rooms. The biggest problem with this game is repetition, I think somewhere around 70-80% of rooms are always empty and are basically the same. It\\'s really boring to be honest, and even the ocasional jump-scare won\\'t impress you after you realise you spent 3-4 hours pressing E to proceed in a \"horror\" game. It had some interesting ideas to it, but it\\'s just too boring to play. I guess if they made the rooms more random it would have been ok, but eh. It still feels boring and bland to play, it\\'s ok for the first 15-20 minutes but don\\'t expect much to change.The good:Good audioDecent atmosphereThe Bad:Lackluster gameplayRepetitive roomsLack of variety overallBoringA 4/10 at best',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewThis is a game that I would have spend $10 dollars to buy. First of all, it's a completely new concept for a horror game that completely blew my mind. Also, the variety of monsters in this game is superb, and all of them equally terrifying. I must say though, the puppet was the most terrifying since it reminded me of the weeping angels from Dr. Who (yes, I am a nerd, I know that.) Conclusion? Download the game! It's amazing, it's free, and an excellent horror experience!

The game would be better if it had full controller support. Other than that, it's perfect! It's startling, scary, and spine tingling. Not for the average gamer. Oh, and if you though Five Nights at Freddy's was bad, try this. Have fun!\",\n",
       " \"Just finished the game and while it does have quite an atmosphere to go on as well as the music, the game do become rather repetetive with the rooms. From what I understand the rooms that are not scripted are randomized and yield different results.The specimens were unique in their own ways, but they weren't too much of an issue once you understand how each work and can deal with them with rather ease.The stories that you learn throughout the game have no lasting appeal in the game, they happen and once you get past one it's over and is forgotten suddenly.Playing through the game by making it past 1000 rooms is not worth it, you're not rewarded with the endeavours you go through, it's basically just a non-standard game over anyway where you accomplish nothing, i.e., just a bad ending.On another note, it is indeed for free so you could give the game a go and see for yourself whether you'd like the game or not.

       " \"Early Access ReviewWow, I can't say enough about this game.  Simple to learn, graphics are pretty basic but still get the scares across and the sound track works with the game.  The timing for the jump scares is great.  They get you into a false sense of security then out of nowhere whamo.  Then later in the game as the spicimens are chasing you the jump scares are so much worse.  Yet we all keep coming back for more?  Great game and the price is better.  I would gladly have paid $10 for this game, however it was FREE!  1000 rooms, jump scares and a great story too?  Can't beat it with Michael Jackson's dead hand.\",\n",

       " 'Early Access Review*note* Pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indieDB and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games (and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version 1.2). Now for the review.I\\'m not really a person who could judge what is considered \"cute\". i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing. that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn\\'t need to follow the path to catch you. So in that regard i guess you could call them scary too. i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room (like how they were in the indieDB version i played). But outside of those \"enemies\", the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing. on top of that if it\\'s your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there\\'s no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances. What i mean is that unlike other horror games (good ones that is) there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the \"rules\" to win against said enemies are laid out. take for example the first resident evil, the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing what\\'s in the room with you. following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie A) you\\'ll notice you use up almost all your ammo and B) that you\\'ll take damage whereas avoiding it you\\'ll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies (well agile while using tank controls) so evasion is a preferred option when you can.That\\'s not to say that how the enemies appear in SPHJ is bad in fact the opposite. the fact you don\\'t know when you\\'ll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds it\\'s own eeriness as you don\\'t know what the next room holds for you. You have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker.However this brings up an issue i have with the game, there\\'s way too much luck involved. i\\'ll give a good example, the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out, just run. but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first \"catwalk\" room (that\\'s what i call it at least, the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions). If you just dead sprint you have a 50/50 chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in 3 hits.There are other points like this as there\\'s an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough i\\'ve yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong (or right in my case as, again, i haven\\'t encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs). so like i said, this game takes alot of luck if you\\'re going to get far (or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run).the other issue i have i\\'m not sure if it\\'s an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if it\\'s just how the game happened to be made. the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room. what i mean is that you can\\'t just hold down the W key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room. No, in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move. this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you won\\'t move (and take damage) till you remember to release the forward key and press it again. Like i said i\\'m not sure if it\\'s intentional or not, if it\\'s not then i hope the devs will work on this as it\\'s basically a cheap beginner\\'s trap. But other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and can\\'t wait to see what the full release is like.',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewI want to preface my review by stating that I find this game to be fun even with the minimalist aspects of walking from one room or passage to another. The intrigue of what will be in the next room entertains me and leaves me with a sense of wonder. I keep feeling a voice in my head say, \"Just one more room...\" and so on as my character explores the mansion.I love the art design, and the cell-shaded look to it along with the cute \"cutouts\" that pop up in tight spaces here and there look very well done. I will have to say this though, there was a constant popping in the audio feed which made it a bit annoying to continue further in the game and it also took me at least ten tries before I could get past the warning screen and move ahead in the game without it crashing on me. I actually thought I was doing well, making it to the 75th room when I stopped to play a mockup of House of the Dead, and the game crashed on me yet again.I hope that they fix that bug as well as the audio bug that is still haunting this game because I think it has a lot of potential; I for one have to say how terrified I was of what happened in room 60 and beyond.For now, this game gets a 6/10. Pros:~ Great Art Design that looks great and brings me back to 1995 and Doom related games.~ While there are a lot of rooms that seem the same, there are subtle nuances that make them a bit different each time.~ The Jump scare moments, especially with the cute cut-outs actually got me. Kudos.~ Easy to get hooked.Cons:~ Audio bug that sounded like a bowl of Rice Krispies in my ears.~ Game is prone to crashing on the warning screen especially but anytime after that as well.~ No options section in the main menu except to teleport to different sections of the game (Room 50, 100, 150, etc.)',\n",

       " 'Early Access ReviewSo I\\'m playing this game thinking \"Oh I\\'ve been pretty well at horror games in the past. This shouldn\\'t be too hard.\" WRONG. HOLY CRAP IS THIS GAME WELL MADE. Okay, so it rips off some other horror games, but it uses them all pretty well. When you get to a new checkpoint, and move to a new area, the door animation looks directly ripped from the first Resident Evil. That alone sent chills down my spine. And the fact that no two games are the same makes for an interesting playthrough. What might have been the way to get out of a room once might change completly the next time you find that room. Oh, and you will also find the same rooms all the time. The only differences are that some monster/ghost is in the next room. With the hidden layers of story like FNAF, the gameplay of Amnesia (wandering around aimlessly), and the erieness of Slender, this game is fantastic.',\n",

       " 'Early Access ReviewThis is basically FNAF\\'s formula of taking something simple and throwing enough mystery at it to keep you interested.

It\\'s a very simplistic idea but it\\'s also done very well. Even the jump-scares are done right, showing that timing and sound is what matters.There is a story and it\\'s rather cute. Cute enough to be out of place, and that\\'s why it\\'s good. Everything feels out of place just to screw with you. It\\'s not a pretty game with high quality gore and HD blood. It\\'s a simple game that throws you into the unknown and cute world of \"something is off but I can\\'t put my finger on it\".The only issue that I had with it is the framerate.

       " 'Early Access ReviewOverall, the game has a lot of unused potential. Its fun for a while, going through the randomly generated rooms. However, there is just too much laid back time. I find myself running through the rooms, just trying to make it to the next save point.  It would be nice if the monsters within the house appeared even just a little bit more often, or if the room designs varied much more. It was bland seeing the same rooms over and over again.The chases are nice. The music goes along well with the chases, as well, creating a good environment for when your running away from death. The designs of the things you see inside are very interesting and creepy indeed.All it really needs is more variety and less time spent walking through a load of empty rooms.

       " \"Early Access ReviewThe things I dislike about Early Access title, is that indie developers never fulfilled their promises.  I know there's a lot of them that are still not complete to this day.  So hopefully this interesting horror game can final nail it.  Spooky's House of Jump Scares is very similar to one series that is part of the Creepypasta Universe: SCP Foundation.  Also know as Secure Contain Protect.  This game has the similar premises of the SCP Foundation, and its a decent one at best.  These specimen you encounter adds nice tension throughout each same rooms that you enter over and over again, even the game mentions about it, if you read the notes that is to get you more invested to the game lore.  The game sadly doesn't learn a thing or two from Bloodborne and Alien Isolation, which those game refines the horror genre completely.  Yes I am aware this came out at January before Bloodborne got released.  I would have expected the game break free from the cliches that horror games have been stuck with in the past.  I'm looking at you both Slender and Amnesia!The gameplay is all about running away from the Specimen and go to one room to the next.  You have a health bar and stamina system that it seems its trying to play like Dark Souls a bit in First-Person, the game has no boss battles at all, so the challenges is to run away and dig yourself into the game lore.  You take damage if your too close to the Specimens, however you can get instant killed by one of them if your not very careful in one room.  You do get an axe very late in the game but combat feels sloppy at times, maybe it'll be better integrated at full release?  Sadly the game is not complete right now.  There's still a few rooms to go in order to see more Specimen and finally know the truth behind this curses house and the company behind it.The optimization is bad, there's no way to change the resolution, or the game doesn't have settings to make the game perform better.  You can change the framerate but that about it.  Hopefully, the creator will make the game run a lot better than the state its currently in right now!  Visually its not a bad looking game, the Specimen looks nice, they have quite disturbing powers to mess with you, and the sound effects are average at best.  Not much to say about the score, its ok for now.  Maybe the final build will have a good credit theme when you reach the one room to get the answers we all want.  Who knows when this will be finished.  So I'm recommending this.  Because its free, and well despite its disappointing shortcomings the game has potential to be something worth playing from beginning to end.  Why not let your friends play it, or better let some young child play it and he or she will know what its like getting their guts spooked!  Hee hee hee...\",\n",

From the humble beginnings of kawaii cardboard cutouts (the first 2 or three will make you jump), the game slowly but surely builds into a more menacing beast, with a host of different creatures that include some great throwbacks to other great creepypastas/horror games. The games controls are simple, with you bieng able to move around Fps stylie and interact with objects such as keys and doors (and I think theres an axe later on) as well as some hilariously misgiving minigames that pretty much give you a summary of the game as a whole in the sense that they go from innocent to ultraviolent in mere miliseconds...Overall, for the deceptively cute art style, deceptively likeable main character, deceptively lively mu- no actually, the music doesn\\'t lie to you at all, I would really recommend giving this game a shot.

Forgive my profane remarks, but I was under the impression that this would be a joke game, kind of silly. But I was wrong, oh was I so so dearly wrong. The first few jumpscares are cardboard cutouts that are so cute, they're terrifying. The sudden nature of their breaking out destroyed me. There are little boss monsters, but nothing too major. At least until that... little girl. Ugh. The main horrors are based off of a myriad of different horror games. There is a slime monster, that I just equate to Slimer from Ghostbusters. There is a spider that is from Resident Evil. There is a little ghost girl whom I can only assume is from F.E.A.R. And then the return of death incarnate for me. Silent Hill references.

The game starts out very cute and innocent, the first \"enemies\" in the game are cardboard cutouts of skeletons and slimes that pop out from the wall.

So I play, lovin\\' the graphic style, then things start popping out and I start getting terrified to the point I\\'d rather just play Amnesia.Since then, this game has muc bigger rooms, more objects, a weapon, many more sounds for the scares, windows, etc. I actually played it a bit too much to where it didn\\'t really scare me but after this it got me because of these new sounds. There are also dark rooms in which a flashlight is needed, and the HUD has been improved. This game can really turn into something amazing. What I disliked is the stupid intro.. It was meant to be funny, I\\'m sure, but it annoyed me, it\\'s my opinion so..The downfalls; The options menu is terrible in my opinion, I sat in my chair pressing enter about 20 times trying to turn Invert Mouse on, but had to position it perfectly under the line, it\\'s a horrible set up compared to how the rest of the game is. The game is also not complete, but this is a small issue as many people will probably quit and uninstall after a certain \"ghost\" starts following in room **.

Just Freaking Grab IT ALREADY!!Alright, fair enough this is my review after a first look at Spooky's House of Jumpscares. A really cool, interesting and original psychological horror game. With a cute and simplistic art style, the game does a really good job of immersing you into the atmosphere, with creeping looking corridors, scattered notes, and well timed music. The jumpscares are spaced enough to not be too common, but they do come up at just the right time to scare your♥♥♥♥♥♥off. The multiple kinds of enemies to doesn't allow you to get to comfortable, but the progression through them is very well made. And with a few minigames to add some subtle messages to it, this game is totally worth the grab... even more so since it's free. Totally recommend it... 10/10.If you're still not convinced, I played this game live on twitch, so if you're interested to see how it looks, here's the highlights: http://www.twitch.tv/caramida10/c/6602001I only managed to make it to room 300 before my heart gave out, but I'm really pumped to continue.

It starts off cutesy but soon gets darker (in lighting and tone).7/10Review:Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a fairly fun 'horror' game. It starts with a rather cute looking ghost 'spooky' telling you to traverse the rooms of the mansion, Along the way you'll see cute cardboard cutouts of octopi and ghosts. As you get further into the mansion you will meet other monsters that will chase in a less jump scary fashion such as a slime monster or a ghost girl.The only real downfalls this game has is that it is rather repetitive, as it is jump scares after a short while they lose their edge and scariness so you just end up speeding through each room and majority of the monsters are just slow chasers so you can just outrun them. It does have some different sections amidst the repetitive-ness such as a space-like section, a rusty school section, etc.It's mainly a shame that after room 760 there is nothing new (for now) as the developer has a message pop up stating that from then on it is incomplete.\",\n",

       " 'Overall: Not very Interesting, repetitive.There are some levels that just skull♥♥♥♥ you for no reason, offering no skillful way to counter it other than hitting escape and exiting the game. Lacking save points make the player more on edge, but in turn make gameplay experience suffer because if one level is failed, you have to repeat countless levels with no rewards. Although I do enjoy the cartoon jump scares somewhat, it seems as if they are just thrown in to make a boring game less boring, but end up being a mere annoyance once the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses start showing up. Randomly generated levels with minecraft\\'s \"10 blocks\" render distance setting on fails to even create the illusion of skillful navigation within long levels. The lack of variance in level design makes interest fade in the middle stages of the game. Minor issues such as having to re-press \"W\" every time a level loads in order to keep moving forward adds a unending inconvenience that makes repeating levels that much more boring to navigate. OP Enemies with minimal deterrent methods (The \"Ben Drowned\" Creepypasta enemy which you just have to keep looking at for the remainder of the level, which proves boring when you get slapped with a bunch of linear \"Maze Pit Levels\") remove any psychological deterioration elements from the game, as they just become a minor annoyance, *with exception of the monster that turns the graphics into bone-shilling youtube666-era designs*.  Sound design is good, as music is intentionally screeching in order to install anxiety within the player, but some cartoon jump scare sounds drag on and unneededly ruins the \"Spooky\" aesthetic. Good for the first while, but I don\\'t think a lot of people could enjoyfully complete the full 1000 Levels. Not from being scared, but from boredom. ',\n",

On first glance, it may seem like a simple game where you click on images of lightly dressed cartoon women as they moan, but describing the game like that would be like judging a book by it's cover.Sakura clicker actually has more depth than the Mariana trench. The gameplay consists of clicking the fine women, and aquiring gold as you do so.You can use this currency to upgrade the damage you do as you click the ladies, or purchase items that do damage over time.the game also allows you to customize your protagonist with various clothing and hairstyles that you can purchasefor a dollar each as DLC.

       " ' Note: This is going to be a \\'serious\\' review Normally I like Sakura games. They\\'re fun perverted visual novels with absolutely Ludacris plots, dialogue, and situations that scream fan service with copious amounts of anime boobs, butts, and the occasional tentacle monster or two. However Sakura Clicker is anything but that. Yes, it does have Anime girls(dressed as animals and Ancient Egyptian gods for some reason - so I guess if you get off to Anubis or Osiris this is the game for you) but that\\'s really it. You click on those Animal/Egyptian god Anime girls to do damage while your character stands awkwardly to the right and watches you. Each Animal/Egyptian God Anime Girl you defeat drops gold which you can use to hire Hero\\'s to help you or upgrade stats and that\\'s basically it. All you end up doing is basically click as hard as you possibly can until your wrist feels like it\\'s about to implode and ending up on the next monster. The game is a never-ending grind fest of just doing that over and over again while facing the same 5ish Animal/Egyptian God anime girls over and over again. So why this game was made you ask? \"Oh it can\\'t be that bad, it\\'s free right?” One answer: To sell DLC outfits to thirsty guys that makes your character that stands to the right be wearing a bra made out of a ribbon or something. PROS It\\'s freeThe girls moan when you click themI guess this game could finally quench someone’s thirst who has an ancient Egyptian God fetish CONS Pretty obvious the game was made to sell DLCDLC is overpriced (for a dollar it doesn\\'t even change how the monsters look - just the outfit of your character who stands to the left and creepily watches you play this game)Grind fest Conclusion Skip over this one. If you really want to play a Sakura game, check any of the other Visual Novel ones out or wait for Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2. ',\n",

       " 'Product received for freeSakura Clicker is a game where you click on various girls (named and costumed like \"monsters\") to win and to get coins. You can click on any place on the girl. There\\'s no difference in the results. With the coins, you can buy more levels and allies. The allies fight for you automatically. The higher levels and improved allies allow you to keep winning without having to wait forever for the enemy hitpoints to go to zero, as the later enemies have ever more hitpoints than the previous ones. They also have more coins. The enemies and looting appear in an endless sequence. But despite the millions you amass, some things can be only bought from the Steam store with real money, apparently. But the game developers have to earn somehow. Thats reasonable.Pros- Resembling \"Adventure Capitalist\", this game crystalizes the shallowness of the hack&slash  \"RPG\": you repeat mindlessly, some number increases somewhere ad infinum.- Revolutionary \"your damage only\" mode: the enemies do not even fight back.- The graphic design is pretty enough. The background changes now and then too.Cons- There are no cutscenes or adult content (unless you consider whats visible on the Steam screenshots as such).- You might expect the girls to lose clothes when you click on them. They don\\'t. They wince and make a hentai-type exclamation or moan, often quite agreeable of having been beaten. That might be considered a plus, based on viewpoint.- The gameplay is incredibly shallow, you can mainly decide which ally to upgrade and when to hire.- There is no story.

This is a hentai game in about the same way that the moon is made of cheese. From a distance, someone uneducated could percieve it to be true, but it's just not. At most it's Ecchi, but the scantily clad anime women don't actually undress, pose in any manner that is remotely provocative, or try to make romantic advances on the player. The moaning and whining sounds risque at best, but you'd have to be severely innocent to be able to get an honest fap out of this game. Yes, the game does move at a slow crawl, but it's an idle game. It plays it's damn self when you close it, and then you come back to it. And you do other things. Nothing terribly new here. Some folks complain about a lack of monster variety, but I'm guessing they only played a few minutes, and never got to higher levels where things like dragon girls, harpies, and bunny girls start to show up. Perhaps the pacing for revealing new monster types is too slow for folks? It's meant to be slow. Found it fun to play while doing a lot of other things, which I am pretty sure is the intent. The different moans, while amusing, do run a bit old after a while. Thankfully there are options to silence everything if you want to. There are in game purchases, but they don't in any way affect the gameplay, which actually strikes me as a very honest free to play model. Buying outfits is not to enhance the gameplay: it's strictly there to support the developer, and you don't have to do it to enjoy pretty much everything the game really offers you.I'll probably unlock everything on this game over a period of a month or two, like with Clicker hero, before I get bored of it.The game may also have interesting updates in the future.

       " 'As someone who is not a fan of anime, this was an odd experience for me.  I imagine a large amount of the supposed appeal for this game lies in an enjoyment of this particular art style.  However, I must evaluate this game based on the experience I had with it, not the experience the core demographic might have with it.  I do have a fair amount of time invested in similar clicker and idle games.  Based on that exposure, I can say with some certainty that this is one of the worst clicker games on Steam.First of all, the sound design (the audio of which I imagine takes up a large portion of the space required for this game) is grating, which is a shame, since the game\\'s description proudly touts the \"included 800+ moans as you defeat the monsters\".  Despite the apparent variety of \"moans\", they all sound about how you might expect without even playing the game.  Why there had to be over 800 of these sounds which are almost indistinguishable from each other, I do not know.The music, which plays on a one minute loop (which is fairly standard for these types of games), is fine on its own.  They seemingly put in a lot of effort in the \"moan\" audio library, so it\\'s odd that they didn\\'t put that kind of effort into the soundtrack.  That might have been a plus, since one minute loops do get tiresome after dozens of hours.  The other sound effects aren\\'t particularly special and there are no volume sliders.Secondly: the art style.  It isn\\'t terrible, but I\\'m not a fan of it.  A cursory glance at Steam titles with the tag \"Anime\" on them all seem to have basically the exact same style.  The women all look like they had an unfortunate slip into a shallow puddle of vaseline.Every one of the \"monsters\" are just anime women wearing fragments of clothing that suggest they are the creatures they are supposed to represent.  Anubis has dog ears and a tail, Bear has claws and a smaller tail, Boar has weird ears and a longer tail, and Aqua has...a sash?  Alright.  You might notice very quickly that the designs for these \"creatures\" are very cut-and-paste and uninspired.  I suppose the goal was to make the women vaguely resemble the thing the title suggests they should be without sacrificing their appearance, in which case I guess they did that fairly well.  I don\\'t understand it, but I\\'m not exactly the target audience for this game.Third, and most importantly: the gameplay.  The gameplay is beyond monotonous.  As someone who has a lot of experience with these types of games, a good degree of monotony is expected, but this is just ridiculous.  In other games, when you progress far enough to \"prestige\" (or \"Rebirth\" in this case), you are given a certain amount of a currency which you can spend to unlock new abilities or increase the speed in which you can reach the point at which you restarted.  Sakura Clicker has a similar system, except considerably slower and less interesting.  Your first Rebirth will probably be spent increasing either your gold gain or damage done by 10% which is almost negligible.  Your second might give you enough to get another 10% and so on.  There is nothing added to the overall experience.I\\'m getting ahead of myself.  The main gameplay loop is to click on a \"creature\" until it dies, collecting gold which you spend upgrading your clicks or hiring auto clickers which do more damage for you, and repeat ad nauseum.  You can level these characters up, increasing their damage, and every once in a while hitting a milestone which gives a passive bonus like increasing their personal damage by 100%, total damage by 20%, or gold gained by 25%.  These are all well and good, but they are way too infrequent and the former boost is going to be useless by the time you can afford the upgrade.  See, these upgrades come at fixed intervals: levels 100, 200, 400, and 600.  By the time you can afford to buy 100 of the same character, their damage output is usually less than 1% of your total damage output even after the upgrade.  The only ones worth getting are the total damage or gold upgrades, but again, these are very infrequent.  Perhaps a dozen hours wasn\\'t enough time to fully evaluate the gameplay aspect of this game, but if you\\'ve played a game for 12 hours and feel like you\\'ve ground to a halt even after multiple resets and you\\'re making no tangible progress, perhaps your game needs to be rebalanced.  It seems like the developer tried to clone another popular clicker game and just stick his art in it, but didn\\'t actually play said game.  That essentially makes this a shameless cash grab, and that becomes clear once you take a look at the 21 DLC options for this title.So if you\\'re looking for a clicker game, there are much better entries out there.  If you want an anime game, I\\'m sure there are much better entries out there.  If you want both, you\\'re going to have to be able to put up with a lot of tedium, but honestly, you\\'d be better off skipping this altogether.',\n",

       " \"I don't know if Clicker Heroes is the first game of that kind, but it certainly is my first, so I consider it as it and compare all the other games to it.If there's one thing done right there, beside the many things, is that it feels honest to you: you never feel cheated on because everything's mathematically correct.Sakura Clicker feels like a rushed game because of many reasons but the progress is certainly one of the worst. You feel like the developers just tried something to see how it goes, without putting much thinking into it.Most of the game is a copy/paste of Clicker Heroes (ascensions included) but with all of the functional changes done wrong.This ends up in upgrade cost being too high for the damage dealt, so the only good thing to do is to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 times then wait to buy the next one, and that wait means close the game and come back later. I know that happens to Clicker Heroes too, but here I mean literally play 2 minutes then idle for 5 hours or more. All the time.Since the aug 3rd update this situation got better, because the devs raised the damage a great lot, but that also proves the fact that this whole thing was just badly planned at the beginning, and it still doesn't feel right.This game suffer from many problems, and even though the devs seem to listen to the players and actually implement stuff that most people are asking, that could have be done before releasing it, and anyway we're far from something working right.It all feels like a cardboard game, with little to no animations (the only one being the enemies closing their eyes when beaten), just a few 8-bit like sound effects, and a short looping music that will get annoying very soon. The character design is nice but  it is just an excuse to attract people, because that's really the only good thing of this game.That said, those girls are just random, and there doesn't seem to be any pattern in their dressing. Bosses are just the same girls, but stronger.Your character is shown on the playfield, and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game. Most stuff has to be purchased with real-world money before being able to wear it (like the most sexy dresses), and that's the only thing you can purchase. The problem is that it just stand there doing nothing, so it doesn't really make sense to even be there.This game really feels like a quick cash-grab as there's nothing interesting to do while it runs beside purchasing upgrades, which, as I said, isn't really anything strategical since you just purchase the best ally and forget about the rest, so for most of the time you'll just have the game closed collecting money for you.The progress is non-existant as you can't really see any beside the small number indicating the level, because the game is always the same: random girls with a new random background every 10 levels.The worst thing about this game, though, is that you don't know where you are going.On Clicker Heroes you always have a clear objective, which isn't only to get further than your last ascension but it also gives you some clear short/mid/long range objectives to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them, which are the in-game achievements. You have a reason to go further and a clear objective, and you also see an ending point to reach.In this game you don't have any. You just beat these always-the-same enemies for no reason at all, forever.Reaching further bosses has no meaning either, as they are simply another randomly-dressed girl which gives you nothing more than some coin, as all the other enemies.I see it as if this game tried to be another clicker with its own identity, but this new identity failed to be attractive and don't even work right.\",\n",
       " \"Sakura Clicker: The Newest and Greatest chapter in the Fire Emblem legacy.I'm honestly surprised that they released the newest Fire Emblem exclusively to PC, and for free! I was flabberghasted, and promptly downloaded it and started to play. And what I played was the most gripping, emotional experience I've ever had with a video game. This game is up there with the greats. Shadow of the Colossus, Ocarina of Time, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (preferably with the '& Knuckles' addon), Paper Mario: Sticker Star, and many more.I've already beaten the game, and I cannot wait to do a New Game +.Do I recommend Shin Megami 5: Fire Emblem 15: Sakura Clicker?Yes.\",\n",

On one hand their visual novels aren\\'t hard to read by any means. I mean, the girls are cute and it\\'s light hearted enough to not take offense to anything.

That being said, when women are pretty much rubbing their used panties against your face, I think you have the go ahead.  See, what Sakura clicker does right is that it just kind of gets rid of that fool they force you to learn about in their other products. This time they replaced the self insert male character surrounded by cute girls by making said character a cute girl. The game is a clicker, as it says in the title. What you do is click on \"monsters\" until they\\'re defeated so you can make gold to recruit more heroes to help you fight said monsters. Considering how the monsters react to your attacks I assume that spanking is involved in some way. There really isn\\'t much to say about the game other than this. There\\'s a little bit of customization that you can do to your avatar. I added cat ears and a tail to mine so that says something about me. Sakura Clicker isn\\'t for me. I see the appeal in clicker games, and cute monster girls can really take something like this so far for me. My enjoyment of this game was directly tied to the condition of my doodle. Do you enjoy clickers? Then by all means, go nuts. Do you enjoy cute girls with cat ears? Well this will keep your attention for a little bit longer. Other than that, play about 30 minutes, write a fan fiction about the events, make a mess of your keyboard, have yourself a good ol time.

       " \"TL:DR The new update annihilated the game, don't waste your time until the positive reviews start coming back.The long version is that the game had some minor balancing issues, it played less like a clicker game and more like a macro game until you got to higher zones, when finally your clicks mattered to how much damage you'd do. Additionally, Attack Speed was a little broken since (as far as I know from how far I got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with Spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on Attack Speed and get Damage and Gold Gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.Taking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, HOWEVER the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (You gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). It now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.The only positive thing I can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. Legitimately the only positive thing I can say.\",\n",

       " \"I think the best way to review a game like this is to break it down, in order to highlight everything properly:ART & DESIGN---------------Dude, 10/10 waifus. You got a huge array of waifus to punch, from the normal Cat, Fairy, and Dragon Girls, to the more out there Mud, Plant and Yuki-Onna Girls. And with each type of girl having a few different design assets, there's a surprising range of designs for the hoards of waifus you'll be clicking through. And if you're sad enough, you may even recognize a couple of assets, backgrounds, and girls from other Sakura games. And there's lots of diversity? You can also customize your player character, and if you shell out, you different little outfits for her, which, depending on the type of person you are, may interest you.SOUND-------I recommend playing this game 100% volume with no headphones to maximize the experience. The constant animu moaning that comes from this game is a wacky and fun thing to hear, and sometimes you get to hear Nya~!, which is, well, horrible, but the ironic charm is fantastic. This is all family friendly fun, you see.GAMEPLAY-----------It's your standard clicker game, where you click the waifus to add them to your harem (Yes, you punch monster girls to add them to your harem, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic) and get currency to purchase automatic clickers, and upgrades for them to make your clicks do more damage/make the automated attacks stronger/have little power ups. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but why fix what isn't broken? The clicker model has been proven, and this doesn't look to screw it up. The real differentiator comes from...DIFFICULTY CURVE--------------------Yo, this game gets pretty difficult in the end game. This clicker separates the men who wanna look at anime t*tties from the men who wanna play a decent clicker game, and also look at anime t*tties. You'll have to learn to utilize the reset mechanic, as well how to distribute points in order to maximize profit and progress as far as you can, or else you'll plateu in progression. You'll have to take what you learn from previous runs in order to get better.OVERALL----------This game is a MASTERPIECE. Clicker games are tried and true fun times, and this game is no exception. But pair this with the dynamic, diverse waifu punching, the FANTASTIC sound design, and actual strategy involved, it takes the game from an ironic 7/10 meme to a fun 10/10 time waster clicker game. Also, the fact that you can turn it off and still get cash helps level progression, and will save you from racking up too many hours actually in game, sparing you from the embarrasment of your family, friends, and colleagues.

       " 'As requested by a loyal fan, here is my review of Sakura Clicker.This game was created by the same folks behind the classic \"Sakura Swimclub\" and \"Sakura Dungeon\", but instead of the visual novel flare, this game instead is based upon the browser game \"cookie clicker\" where you click a cookie, however, in Sakura clicker, you are instead clicking on anime girls. as you progress, the girls you click on will gain more health, requiring you to hire new girls who do more damage to aid in adding the enemy girls to your harem (this also includes bosses). Gold is usually used to hire new girls, but beyond this, there is an underlying method of levelling girls, for example; to unlock abilities like added 5% gold per girl or +20% damage you may have to spend gold to get a hero to lv100 for an added 100% attack bonus. Additionally, it is possible to prestige to gain bonuses at the cost of your progress. A mechanic which I enjoyed was how you could close the game, but when you return you are rewarded with gold which you would have earned if you had stayed on, but returning to the game may be required for fighting bosses, requiring your presence to click and activate abilities (gained once leveling up the main hero). Another aspect of the game I found interesting was how every (enemy) girl has a slightly different look, whether it is the apparel, hair or eye colour. The music on the other hand does suffer from being repetitious. As far as I am aware, there is no story to date or lore, as well as no ending, or character development, however there is a girl by the side of the screen whom you can customise with a small variety of free hair, skin, eye and clothing options for free, but beyond these are microtransations for weapon, clothes and hair dlc (which Im personally not a fan of, but does not harm the core gameplay). All in all, it is a solid clicker game, another hit by the Sakura Team.Recommend that you play the game with the music and sound effects off, with the voice left on.Another gripe of mine would be the absence of a ~buff man in the game.',\n",

Keep the volume down or your neighbours will think you\\'re molesting a dozen underaged Japanese girls.> First always try to unlock a new \"ally\", they are far more useful than investing in the same ones for long.> When you can\\'t afford a new ally any time soon invest in the last one a few more times.> When you reach ridiculous numbers it\\'s time to go back and upgrade allies but DO NOT attempt to get damage buffs that only affect themselves, this is a major trap with NO GAIN.

Boosting the Attack Speed is expensive but super mega worth it, second priority: boosting Gold, Ally Damage and All Damage.

Can be more than this or just stagnant here. Personally, I don't believe that can be more than this. There are some aspects that make the game be banal, like as weapon balance, some (or maybe the majority) weapons don't have no recoil, and the damage taken or induced is very weird. Btw, I played in a map much imitated of the Dust 2 of the Counter-Strike. I don't know the name but the map have very similar details. I don't like imitations.One more thing, if you have any first-person-shooter game experience, you'll literally be the best player on here and there is a great possibility of being called a hacker. One ranked as gold in CS GO can be a global here in just 20 minutes (lol). I got that feeling. Or in WARMODE just have low skill players.The game isn't bad but there are really betters on Steam. Some aspects like lag need to be fixed, servers are unstable. And please, don't compare CS GO to WARMODE, it only reveals ignorance. Counter-Strike has many years, already suffered so many changes and for sure is better, incomparable, WARMODE is an early-alpha game. The game is free, soft and with a simple interface, you need to consider these aspects too before give a negative review just because yes. I'll give a chance and I'll come back later.Positive points. (+)Free-to-play.Simple and fun interface.The devs read the reviews.Negative points. (-)Majority of the weapons don't have no recoil.The damage taken or induced is very weird.Could have more mods and maps.Need to fix some servers with lag. \",\n",

Let me explain, if you are low on you’re steam account and can’t afford CS:GO. Then this would be the great alternative for you. But, if you already own CS:GO, it’s not really recommend for you to play it. Since it already has the same motives and traits to CS:GO. But anyways, my final review score for this game is a 5.5/10 and hopefully the developers will improve these problems and add something different to the game.

I really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapons with currency you gain from killing enemies, the only downside is the fact that everyone starts the match with 2000 and that defeats the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon. There also needs to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friends and start a match.

I left my friends my uninstall note, when I recieved a message of light and hope - \"get warmode♥♥♥♥♥\" Since then, I have become immersed in the amazing teamplay, unique guns, and well polished maps. The economic system scales incredibly well in Skirmish matches, and the guns are so well balanced that it appears as if years were taken to get them just go.

The best part is that there is no pay to win issue at all, since you can buy guns with points in every match.

       " \"Early Access ReviewI want to recommend this game because it in its self is a fun game. However there are many draw backs.Pros:- It runs (automatically better than most free to play games)- Has a lot of potential- A Counter Strike sort of gameplay for those who enjoy that (buy gear at the beginning with credits, get kills for credits, etc.)- VERY fast paced gameplay and heavily relies on reaction to events.- [This is an opinion for me] Small maps work very well for this game, they're no larger than a Counter Strike or Call of Duty map. Cons: - No unlocking or loot system, only items in game are cosmetics bought with real money. (Nothing expensive, most items are $1 or $2, but the point still stands) - Game disconnects from matches 75% of the time, forcing the user to loose all credit towards their next rank they gained that match- VERY unbalanced. Certain guns rule the game and others are useless. The SPAS-12 shotgun is one of if not the best gun and you can buy it with the credits you get when you start the match. Also many guns are over powered, under powered, bad aim, too good aim, etc. The shotguns can only hit up to about 5 yards and if its not point blank then its ~1 damage. The pistols have no recoil giving those who are good with them or hackers (more on that later) a very easy chance. The assault rifles are crap, bad recoil, large cone of fire, damage regarding range is bad (AK's give more damage at 10 yards than an M4 Carbine)- Clipping errors. The models and entities clipped into eachother often.- Headshots. This one sounds like a pro but its not, the head hitboxes on a player are massive, Making nearly every shot you take a headshot and an instant kill. - Lag. I know you'd think a game thaat doesnt require much of a computer and only a 200mb download wouldn't lag much but it seems you're wrong. Certain guns when fired cause small lags spikes as if the audio, animation, and effects have never been precached or loaded at all. Then shooting them again causes the same lag like its loading it brand new again causing the fast paced gameplay to be choppy and ultimately make you loose. - Hackers. Good lord the hackers. It's mostly small children aimbotting with the starting pistol. Normally that would be fine but considering 2 of the other cons  mentioned. that pistol is a 1 hit kill when its a headshot (even if you have the max armor upgrasde which doubles your health) and  the head hitboxes are enormous. That being said they instantly kil you. THIS GAME NEEDS AN ANTI-CHEAT BADLYAll in all I'd probably say a 5/10 with tons of room for improvement and a lot of potentional. If the devs fix those cons and bugs, and implement a working anti-cheat of some sort (this is none of right now) then I can see my review changing to positive and my time spent playing this game going up drastically, maybe even buying some items from the ingame store.\",\n",

It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.简体中文：毛子做的游戏，挺有意思的。虽然画面不咋地而且武器后座力基本不存在，但是进游戏去虐虐歪果仁还是挺好玩的。毕竟是免费游戏所以不要期待它会有3A大作的质量。游戏内商城基本就和没有一样，所有武器在初始时都已经给了，你要做的就是在游戏里杀人赚钱买好枪。商城里只有名片徽章和面具，然而这些并不会影响人物和武器属性。如果想打发时间或者找点免费游戏玩的话，这款游戏还是挺好的。\",\n",

And even  if that♥♥♥♥♥♥will get banned he will be back in 5 seconds with a new steam account, since it's free to play.Devs at least add a ♥♥♥♥ing kick option, you must clearly autistic.....Another option is to make a game non free to play, like at least 5$ or something.Other than problem with hackers, game has some potential.\",\n",

Some hackers are somewhat decent though... atleast let you get some kills in, they just want a rage finish usually, I have not seen a hacker that has stayed more then 15 minutes... ignore them, They leave... They have fun listening to you rage... Best bet is just to ignore them, they usually go to another server looking for the kid that rages.#2:No Vote ban, I know people abuse this... but vote ban is a good thing to have...#3:Can\\'t host your own server.========================Overall...If you are mature and don\\'t mind a troll hacker every now and then... It\\'s free.... It\\'s not that big of a game... Try it....',\n",

       " 'Early Access ReviewAwesome game. Sad thing is when you join you have to use in game points or whatever to buy the guns. the more kills you get the better guns you can get, altjhough you must restart buying them again every round it makes a solid statement and adds a little more uniqueness. most people are hating and giving this game mixed reviews because of their lack of knowledge with FPS games. just about any player that has any FPS experience whatsoever can jump in and kick some serious @ss and all the players getting r@ped come and make that huge commitment to make that negative review as they cry into their keyboard. rarely few have issues with this game. ive heard of _authorization issue but only like 1/20 will actually have this issue.Pros : 1 - Good, Smooth FPS Gameplay2 - Free To Play (For people who dont wanna drop their bank on CSGO when other games can compete at it!)3 - Nice Menu4 - Not bad loading times5 - EXTREMELY easy to kick @ss atCons : 1 - Spawn Shield lasts way too long2 - Pretty decent amount of weapons but their could be more3 - Small Maps4 - Whining Peple in dozens complaining about hackers everywhere (which are just good players, not hackers)Also i have been called a hacker so many times its drilled into my head by now. only thing is that all i play is FPS games 24/7. games like Arma3, Battlefield 4/3, Destiny, etc. So basically i just got alot of experience and i can run in and kick @ss and everyone gets butthurt when i get that 14/1 K/D and then dedicated a review to people just like me. dont listen to people like that. And if your an easy whiner i dont think this is the game for you. but anyone else should jump in and if your good at it just wait for the hate spam of noobs in the chat XD',\n",

In total i have waited for 65mins for this game to load and it hasnt, even if i uninstall the game and reinstall it, it still wont load. Maybe if they fix the problem then the game might be alright but for know this game isnt very good!!!!',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewDustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there.

The guns are ridiculously op, the spawns are broken, there are angles that provide immense advantage (others players can't shoot you), there is no need for iron sights. However, I had loads of fun playing this game. Headshotting from 2km away with a pistol is satisfying. The game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly f2p. I like the point system to buy guns but I think you should be able to gain points over time. Also more options should be implemented (FOV slider for example). The game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as I am concerned. Overall, I thought the game was fun and I could oversee the flaws.

Although the servers were not completely full so about 4 people on each team. At first I thought you had to buy a weapon each time you died e.g. Counter Strike, that's the only thing that took me a few moments to realize that when you buy guns, armor, and other items that you spawn with them for the rest of the game. I also feel that people need to start playing or at least trying this game for a week considering it's in early access and does not need 30GB of space to play which is great in my opinion.

What I mean by that is half of the time your bullets damage an enemy and half of the time they don't. Also the assist system is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that I cant even comprehend it. But my favorite flaw, other than all of the maps being as big as my bathroom, is the random suicide deaths. I'll just be standing there and out of nowhere I die and it says I was killed by me. Now I cant for the life of me figure out what is causing this, it's just completely random.     I really hope that this game is in its beta because it is so close to being a great game. All the game makers need to do is add a North American Channel for servers and fix the major bugs involoved with causing damage, the assist system, add larger maps, and fix the kill system. I would recommend that you try the game for 30 minutes tops and then delete it. I feel that you will agree with me that this game has potential, it just needs some major fixes.\",\n",

They are amazing for a free to play shooter!Gameplay is fast-paced, very fun.The gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.CONS:The teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.The semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.There is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.Most of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.All in all, a great game for early acess.

Balancing Team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.Guns are just a Ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it \"fun\" to shoot at, here is zero fun.

Try your hand at virtual battles with off-scale dynamics and hurricane gameplay in the spirit of the classical shooters. In the game are available a wide range of maps and several modes. Level system allows player to open achievements, weapons, stickers and more.______________MY OPINION_____________Okay. In my opinion, The game is some kind of CS:GO ripoff. Which is why people gets p*ssed off about this game. And clearly, (my reaction to this is) When this game gets banned, THANK GOD FOR THIS UNFORGIVEN GAME ALLREADY.________________GAMEPLAY_________________This game is sh*t. Seriously.

       " \"Early Access ReviewWARMODEThis is a quiet good first game from WARTEAM. This game has its ups and downs, but in this review, I would not judge this game too harshly. This is an online FPS game. A great range/variety of weapons to buy to use against the dangerous enemies. What I find is that the damage the weapons do is not that much, unless you get headshots. But like I said this is WARTEAM's first game and they should keep on trying. Speaking of the developers, they should really keep an eye on this game and do updates/patches.There are a couple of good maps. But the map that really catches my eye, is the one that they ripped off of Counter-Strike. Developers, if you are reading this, I wouldnt recommend to rip off maps from other games because you may get copyright strikes and negetive reviews because you ripped the map off. But I see that you made a couple mps of your own and I quiet like them.The last time I got onto this game, the multiplayer was dead. In patches/updates try putting something into the game that make the game even more entertaining, like more game modes, for example.Overall, I think these developers should keep on trying to update/create games, keep up the good work!7.2/10 \",\n",

Through many dangers, toils and snares,    I have already come;    ’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,    And grace will lead me home.    The Lord has promised good to me,    His Word my hope secures;    He will my Shield and Portion be,    As long as life endures.    Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,    And mortal life shall cease,    I shall possess, within the veil,    A life of joy and peace.    The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,    The sun forbear to shine;    But God, who called me here below,    Will be forever mine.

       " 'Early Access ReviewI have no idea why the dev released this game in this state. its broken. period. weapons are not balenced. serers are extreamly laggy. the only redeaming quality is the fact that even though this game features a store, you cant buy anything that puts pure free player at a disatvantage. Was this game fun? yes it was. does that mean its a good game? no.-=Gameplay=-This game makes me think of counter-strike and COD had a baby and somehow that god aweful game Combat Arms also came in. It plays alot like Counter-Strike, you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points. But the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so laggy you cant ever get a kill. not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights. there is only 1 U.S server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap. Now dont get me wrong, i did enjoy some of the matches. but its hard to denie this game has alot of flaws that quite honestly are un-exseptable. The maps feel bland. you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be. but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action. Spawn camping is another big problem. if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped. -=Sound=-The game tends to be glitchy at times. the guns also dont sound all that amazing. the music you here when you start up the game is nice. but after that is all guns. and thats fine...if the guns were nice to hear. -=Community=-With this being a pure online based game i have to adress community. the community is....there. but its not booming. i havent seen too much \"hacker\" name calling while in a game as of late. but when thegame was first released, it was somthing you saw alot.-=Free or Pay2Win=-This game does feature a store so the dev can get alittle cash dollar. but theres no guns,ammo,or anything that would make it pay 2 win. what is there is slight cosmetic gear. such as face pain and masks. -=Graphics=-The graphics are not anything new, exciteing, or all that special. but they are not the worst. i can deal with the graphics if the gameplay is good. -=Final verdict=-This game is fun, and with more work could be great. but at its current state i just cant reccomend it. the only way i would recomend this game is if there was some way to host your own servers/games and let others join. that would atleast help with the god aweful conection quality of the current servers.

I only played this game because a Steam friend of mine parted with his sanity and played this game so much that he changed his Steam name to 'WARMODE KING'. I wrote this review to save you from such dark actions.Because this is a PC game Graphics are everything, but this game does not deliver in this respect. It resembles a potato on methamphetamine quite well. The objects and environment are of low quality and the textures are sub-par. The animations aren't horrible but they take to long to complete, for example i might go to shoot an enemy but they are already dead and i cant see this because the death animation takes to long to finish.The maps are terrible and arent very detailed, with few static environmental objects. They also lack complecity and are far off something such as CS:GO.To be honest i cant be bothered writing a review for this game its not worth the pain and regretful gameplay.

The shadows are the most unique thing ive ever seen while the story is crispe and incredible and extremely sad at the end I wont spoil it. The character models shine almost as much as the great gameplay, and the story compliments the beutiful gameplay. The gameplay is so great that Ive had multiple hours of staring at the main menu screen with awe while I saw the beutiful graphics of the play button shine into my soul. The buttons are so rectangular that ive always imagined spongebob jumping into them and wearing them as pants. The character's have great voice acting and the back stories are so sad that I don't want to spoil it for you. The reflections into the water are so beautiful that my eyes gush out blood and spew onto my dead cat (My cat died because I played this game for 12 hours straight one time and needed to eat my cat to feed myself because I just couldnt stop playing this beautiful game) (I now have battle scars). This game will always leave beautiful memories of me shooting the same character model in the face precisely 18/5 times before he eventually died and blood spews everywhere and myâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥gets hard. Before I play the game I slap my leg 3 times and screech so that warmode god will finally except me. When I finish a match of this game I throw my headset precisley 13/5 miles so that the warmode god doesn't kill me next time I slap my leg. Overall this game is the most beautiful game anybody will ever play if you do not agree with my review I will take my cats left over remains and smear them on your face until you call me daddy and start to pray to the warmode god. After that I will sacrafice you to the warmode god for accepting his overall beautifulness. Than I will continue to slap my leg. (Still not better then uncrowded)\",\n",

Now this...this actually makes me want to installa notorious P2W game than play this poor game. Ok, well I give it this: It tries to be \"equal\". IF any one is familiar with Begone, a Unity based squad shooter for free, this is the same thing. you log in, load up on kill credits and pay at spawn for armor, grenades etc... so it starts most people off equal and you build up as the match stays open...I personally like that than hard load outs. But this game losses all points when :1) The maps feel baby block desing. Hard to explain but super simple mushy non thinking, turn here fire. 2) Because of this design the damage and hit detectioni is so off. It feels like you are getting hit by paintballs. But problem is, I played better paintball sims. You can walk up and unload two full clips to peoples head and I guess there is a RNG where sometimes it is a headshot, and other times you just slowly reload, and refire. It is soo bad. It just feels so fake and silly....It gives it charm though. If you are tired of one shot kills ing ames like CS:Go and doubt who is a hacker or or skilled... play this, no doubts, everything is pillow fight calculations. You can swing, hit a head, but sometimes you get em RIGHT in the eye. 3) Buggy. This is what happened: I log in, play a round, ok, earn enough to buy a grenade, found out it is cool, you buy it once, don\\'t need to rebuy each spawn. Game ended, I quit the match, joined a new server to get new group of guys. And it says I have 1 grenade in the bottom right. I thought, oh cool. I use it, nothing happens, die. \"Oh a bug. That makes sense I don\\'t have one, I jsut started and don\\'t have the kill credits yet...\" I can live with that bug. So I go back out, decide to do a wall clip shot, you know, you shoot the edge of the wall as you edge out to get anyone hiding behind wall and use your own cover fire....I die....Who killed me? me.... I somehow killed myself....I can only guess this the ricochet off the wall....Like, this game is either so great! SOG EPIC that it calculates deadly ricochet into my skull, or it is so pathetically failing at being an FPS that it has no idea itself as  a game who killed me... I uninstalled on match 2, I can no longer continue. Pure cancer. Oh yeah, before I left, I hung out in match a little longer because I noticed a lot of russians with high knife score in a gun battle. I saw a guy passing walls, floating, and invisibble 1 shotting with a knife....hacked cancer, the worse there is.

       " 'Early Access ReviewIt\\'s very rare that I am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game I don\\'t like. Wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game.....I mean this game is bad and I mean REALLY BAD! The map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. Oh let\\'s not forget when I logged in for the very first time, I received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. I literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. I could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. An option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. My gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. Aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. I lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent\\'s head and opened fire like crazy only to find out I DID NOT HIT HIM ONCE! So throughout the match I sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. And of all the ridiculous solutions I\\'ve found this has got to be the worst. I found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. The trick is you don\\'t aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (I know I\\'m just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). You aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent\\'s chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.And then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which I gotta say wow. People who hack in this game are WAY TOO COMFORTABLE in cheating. From what I\\'ve seen these hackers walk around like \"Yeah I\\'m cheating....The f*** you gonna do about it?!\" In some instances they don\\'t even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. Noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. Not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. But not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so I guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. Shame on me for not noticing this sooner. I get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that NOT ONCE during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. This game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. The problem with the designers is that they don\\'t have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. I can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you\\'re feeling brave enough to play for yourself (Who knows you miles may vary)',\n",

       " 'Early Access ReviewRussian attempt at making basic counter strike clone. It is a bit unusual since it isnt p2w, but it misses core mechanics and anticheat. Menu is basically just a server list and a shop with real cash only skins. These have weird level requirement, but its easy to reach it. Skins go from 50 cents up to 3.5 dollars for the highest level skins. Skins look kind of decent even if they are same pattern reused a lot of times. Sadly they aren\\'t in the steam inventory which makes them pretty much worthless, unless you really want to spend money on this game. There are also some hats and banners, which require payment as well.Game offers 4 different game modes: \"Deathmatch\" (team deathmatch), Confrontation, Sabotage (search and destroy/plant the bomb) and Zombiemode (pvp). I mostly found players playing deathmatch, there is very little of them left though.Now the interesting part, especially for a free to play game is that all the guns are bought and reset during the match. There is no inventory where you manage the guns in the lobby, annoying trial guns, p2w weapons or lucky boxes; instead you enter the match and gain 2000 points (depending on game mode) which you can use to buy some guns for start. The more kills you get, more money you gain progressively during the match which you can use to buy new weapons. These points of course reset for every match, so everyone gets a fair start.Gunplay felt lacking for me, the gunsounds were extremely bad, everyone was running around with knife trying to get some easy kills, since all it takes is one knife slice to get a kill. Running is just way too fast for game to be an enjoyable shooter. Most of guns have pretty horrible spread especially when moving, so you are forced to use ironsights which mostly block off your screen making it even harder to hit a target. Or you could try standing still trying to aim with crosshair while others are running to knife you and cheaters are noscope jumpshooting you.Warmode could\\'ve been at least a bit better casual shooter if it had any kind of anticheat and if devs didnt completely abandon it. Its only feature is that it isnt p2w, but thats about it. It held me for few minutes just so i could try out all the weapons.Pros:- Not pay to win- Weapons are bought with currency earned during match (works something like counter strike)- 4 game modes- Relatively decent looking cheap skins, available for direct purchaseCons:- No anticheat, cheater infested- Abandoned by developers- Small playerbase- Bad gunplay- Bad gun sounds- Small map pool- Running speed is too fast',\n",

Right now, there are not very many ships to choose from, but this is likely to change as the game develops. \"Creeps\" or \"minions\" are replaced by stations that have to be captured and \"towers\" are replaced by simple damage taken when you\\'re in range of the enemy base. Upgrades, as of now, consist only of gathering resources from captured stations and gaining a universal upgrade every level gained. This will probably be changed to specific upgrades later. The middle fuel station buff is extremely helpful, so get that when you can. Warping in a fight is dangerous as it leaves you extremely vulnurable to damage. Choose the right time to warp. Teamwork is essential to victory, and this is tied to having a team with balanced ship types. A well coordinated attack can completely turn the tide of a game and to that end, use the warp paths wisely. Controls may seem sluggish or sticky, but this is mostly due to ship stats. This brings up the important point, know your ship! The strengths and weaknesses of each ship are made very clear after a few games. Knowing the capabilities of each ship during a fight can make the difference between wiping the enemy team and a 60 second respawn. The game asks a lot from your computer on the performance end. Lag is also a pretty big problem right now. Connecting to the servers is always a gamble and crashes happen quite frequently. These things are likely to be fixed in timeThe game is still in alpha, so don\\'t expect this to be anything close to the final product. A lot of what I consider cons will likely change later on.TL;DR Pros-ConsPros:+Solid gameplay+Clear strengths and weaknesses between ships and loadouts+Teamwork a must+Great, detailed ship graphics(Alpha)+/- No way to cancel warp jumps (Alpha?)Cons:-High computer performance demand-Crashes 1/5 times (Alpha)-Few ship choices (Alpha)-Disconnect/can\\'t connect to server 1/5 times (Alpha)',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewBig ships in space? Who wouldn't want to dance the slow and deadly dance of cap.ship slugging it out at each other. FS looks good and I didn't run into any bugs first time running it. Lacking any kind of tutorial the learning curve can be a bit harsh, but once you realize how things works it's a big fun. Team work a must in this one. Grab a copy and jump in, just remember that big ships are slow ;)\",\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewThis is a MOBA game with big spaceships and even bigger potential.Whether the developers will achieve that potential is another matter, but they\\'re definitely on the right track. If the premise sounds appealing to you, you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission. It\\'s very well done.However, it is early access, and as such, there are a lot of missing functions, some balance issues, bugs, and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed. My biggest concern at the moment, in terms of \"I want to have fun right now,\" is the lack of tooltip details.Let me explain. You get choices on which weapons/abilities to load your ship with. However, there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name. So you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they\\'re supposed to work.  Yes, this will obviously be addressed, but in the game\\'s current state, there\\'s sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve.Still, once I figured things out, I started having a ton of fun, and I\\'m glad I paid the $10. I\\'m having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces.',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewVery good game, i lloved SWTORS new space combat system but i was found it stupid just fot that subscribe every mounth, i was looking for a game to replace and finally i found it, the game is new and in early acces, and for this the game is IMBA, but its need worked on it i hope it will not stay like this. Ps: my english sucks i now.',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewFractured Space is exaclty what it says in its description. You are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons/abilities. Inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek, battlestar galactica, dreadnought, star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these games/shows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system.Still in early access so keep in mind some things may change.Their are a total of 12 ships which have varying unique properties. Graphics, effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update. Having more local servers would be nice (to reduce ping) but its quite easy to find a game. With each update the game gets better and better.Overall a great game, essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles. Love to see how this develops. The price for the forerunner and harbinger are woth playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future.EDIT: updated with more current info',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewVery enjoyable game if you enjoy team based objective games. Ships are all fairly interesting and each has it's own unique feel. So far, things seem fairly balanced, every ship has some type of counter ship, and each ship fills a particular role in combat. I would definitely recomend picking it up and giving it a try. Takes a few games to really figure things out, but once you do, it is enjoyable.\",\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewThe Takeaway: Fractured Space has qutie a  lot of good potential. The graphics are great thanks to the UT4 engine. The gameplay is something fairly new and fresh despite being based on existing MOBA archetypes.  I felt that there\\'s enough promise to put my $15 USD on the table after playing just a few matches. It\\'s like Homeworld, World of Tanks, and LoL/DOTA/HoTS had a giant party and everyone got together at the end of the night and this sexy minx is the result.The Good:  Amazing graphics for a MOBA title Fresh gameplay for the genre Intuitive, easy to master controls Unique ship designs that feel plausible as real starships (some folks don\\'t care, but for me that\\'s a HUGE thing) The Bad:  HORRIBLE lag issues. (I\\'m used to SOME lag, but I\\'ve had a few matches where I would jump large distances from where I was or where I intended to be without using any speed enhancing abilites. No tutorial, and for a game as complex as this one can be, at times. There needs to be a bit more information about exactly how matches are supposed to work included as perhaps non-intrusive in-game tutorial messages (Move next to the point to capture and so on. Something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fades out). I\\'ve managed to work out so far you shoot other ships and capture points on the map, but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory isn\\'t readily apparent even after reading the in-game \"How to Play\" primer which barely had enough explanation to fit on an MTG card. There\\'s nothing the actually explains how ship or tech tree progression works either and if you didn\\'t know you could upgrate your ship\\'s systems you\\'ll be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship. HOWEVER THERE IS ONE BIG CAVEAT I\\'LL GIVE TO MY LITTLE BIT OF WHINING ABOVE. I DIDN\\'T BOTHER TO READ ANY OF THE \"HOW TO PLAY\" STUFF OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL SCHEME FOR MY FIRST 3 MATCHES.  ',\n",

       " 'Created 09.25.16Fractured Space is a game about driving your gigantic Spaceship into epic 5v5 team Battles on vast maps, with Sectors of up to 100 Kilometers Length. There are currently 33 Ships available to play. Where they are split into 3 Manufacturers, wich each boast their own distinctive Artstyle and unique Systems.Games can be played in the two currently available Gamemodes \"Conquest\" and \"Frontline\", where the first feels somewhat like a good old MOBA and the latter like a fast King of the Hill match with base-Capture elements.Ships can manouver almost completely free, though you are unable to roll and only limited tilting is possible. Though this goes to ensure that certain ships can function the way they were designed and combat gets more challenging. More on that later.Movement between sectors is achieved via a \"Phase-Relocation\", also called Jump, wich keeps both your orientation and momentum.Fractured Space features a very high depth of mechanics, wich might not jump your thought immediatly and will require some getting used to. Such as the concept of Armor and breaking Armor causing you to take increased Damage from enemy fire.Fractured Space, due to its high depth, delivers lots of potential for very tactical play and thus has huge potential to become an E-Sport in the future.Here are my, personal, Scores for the Game:Graphics: 9/10  The Unreal Engine delivers again! And so do the Art-Devs from Edgecase games! Beatifull looks!Sound: Solid 8/10 Despite the usual \"No Sound in Space\" thing, Fractured Space features a really immersive Soundscape!Depth: 9/10 In terms of Depth, Fractured Space beats most MMOSA\\'s ive yet seen. May be a bit to much for the casual Player.Character Design: 9/10 The Ships you play feel very very Unique, and become so even more with Loadouts and Crew.Gameplay: 7/10 Gameplay is a bit unintuitive at times, but a well done Tutorial helps with the tremedous depth of the Game.Now, do I recommend Fractured Space?HELL YEAH!Its one of the most revolutionary Space-Shooters ive ever seen and the Unreal Engine makes it just SO nice to play and look good. The Game is fair and balanced. No cheaters to bee seen since the game started. There is payed content to the game, but this completely restricts itself to Skins, giving you the cool looks but nothing else. While you can also buy \"Credit Boosters\" to simply get your next ship faster.That being said, a more expensive ship doesnt mean you will have an easier time. Having a newer, more expensive ship gives you absolutely no advantages over other people.Now there are some players i defenitly don\\'t recomment to touch Fractured Space, because the game takes quite some effort to be successful in. So just quickly Jumping in for the pure Ownage will likely not work out.',\n",

I'll say it again - the ships are original, believeable and simply gorgeous.Gameplay is fairly basic, and any time you're not in combat, you will be made acutely aware that you're playing a freemium game; the ads, offers and unlockables take up a fair amount of screen real estate between matches.Battle location choices are still a little limited (at the time of writing)But there's at least 15 hours of satisfying multiplayer here, if you can get servers full of real humans....and damn, son.  Lemme tell ya - Those ships?  So pretty.  drooooooooool.\",\n",
       " \"There's not a lot of Space games on the market that many can get behind. Somewhere down the line, devs effectively equated space with complexity, so for years we were driven away with spreadsheets, graphs, and pure busywork. However the genre continues to be an itch I can rarely scratch with the rare exception (Rebel Galaxy being one).This is another. As the synopsis demonstrates, this is a creep-less MOBA. It has much of the staples. Zone control for resources, except those 'resources' mostly translate to 'team experience'. You zone back to a base in order to 'level up', comparable to how you buy items in DoTa or LoL. After that, it's just a 5v5 beat'em up with a fair bit of strategy and adjustment. Like many space games, you have to think on the fly and move your ship behind the dozens of asteroids that litter the zones in order to mitigate the damage you'd otherwise receive. Like with many team-based games, it's more fun when you play with friends. When pugging, I lost against AI because everyone pulled a Lone Wolf mentality that just does not work here. A lesser ship cannot take a greater one without sniper support. A tank ship cannot 1v2 unless he has a support ship on his back. One match had two snipers in it which meant they remained in the back (As they should) but it meant that we had a fraction of people that could not capture bases with us. The list goes on.There is also no pay to win here. At best, with real money you could buy crew members outright which give you an extra 10% utility here, some 4% damage there, and only serves for diehard minmaxers but the basic set of crew is all one really needs. The real game here is to pick a few of your favorite ships, adapt to their styles, and just win with superior skill, and it won't matter if an enemy does an extra 6% damage or not.Everything else is mostly cosmetic, with the obvious credit boosters and whatnot like every other F2P.One of the things I want to touch upon that has nothing to due with the game's playability or mechanics - But the ship designs are some of the best I've seen in a long time. Just opening the game's tutorial giving the overview of the Pioneer gave me some epic feelings. And then just looking at ships from the Hangar menu, you can tell a lot of love went into their designs. Every inch is covered. You can see storage bays, lights under metal panels, antennae. Kudos to the designers.I've met many like me, needing a space game without it feeling like a second job. This one fits the bill. Space MOBA. That's what it is.\",\n",

New players can quickly pick up a decent cross section of ships, while leaving a few more expenive (and newer) ships as goals to pursue.  The only purchaseable elements are purely cosmetic or means to bypass some of the unlock grind.  Despite some reviews here this game is absolutely NOT pay-to-win.The design team is very active in releasing new updates to the game.

       " 'Zum Release gibt es auch ein aktuelles Review.Fractured Space ist keine 0815-Kost. Der Anfang wirkt chaotisch und unfair. Das liegt mehr oder minder daran, dass die meisten Schiffe spezielle Rollen erfüllen. Fast noch spezieller als in jedem anderen MOBA. Beginnt man mit dem Spiel, denkt man anfangs von seiner Brücke aus, später fängt man (wenn man die anderen Schiffe kennenlernt) an im Teamrahmen zu denken. Dann wird es richtig interessant, aber streckenweise auch etwas frustrierend (wenn das eigene Teamplay nicht so wirklich funktionieren will). Für Solospieler und lonely wolves ist das Spiel nicht geeignet. Für Casualplayer die ihr eigenes Killbedürfnis auch mal hinter Teaminteressen zurückstellen können schon eher.Spielst du mit Freunden? Umso besser! Da es noch keine Ingamevoice-Möglichkeit gibt, bleibt nur der 90iger-Jahre Chat. Das ist definitv nicht zeitgemäß, aber sofern ich die Devs richtig einschätze - und ich habe das Spiel schon eine ganze Ecke - wird das auch noch kommen. Dann eben Curse, oder TS oder wie sie nicht alle heißen :)Fractured Space hat eine steile Lernkurve, sofern man denn will. Auch ist es eines von wenigen Spielen heutzutage, bei dem es Sinn macht Guides und Tipps von erfahrenen Spielern zu lesen. Es ist ein kleines Microuniversum. Genauso wie Schach. Nur eben bunter und bombastischer.Grafik wird durch die aktuelle Unreal Engine auf die Monitore gezaubert. Auch wenn ich kein Fan der UE4 mit ihrem fürchterlichen AntiAliasing bin, so knallt und explodiert es überall ziemlich farbenfroh. Da gibt es kaum etwas zu beanstanden.Der Sound ist ein eigenes Kaliber. Jede Waffe, jede Fähigkeit, jede Tätigkeit hat ihren eigenen einzigartigen Sound und erhöht deutlich die Athmospähre. Es besteht für mich kein Zweifel, dass (wenn die Spieler so wollen) FS ein ordentliches Zeichen im E-Sport setzen kann.Thema Pay2Win:Sofern man Echtgeldkäufe für Schiffe (die nicht besser oder schlechter sind als die Starterships), die man problemlos (4-6 Spiele für die ersten) auch für Ingamewährung kaufen kann als p2w bezeichnen möchte, dann ist es das. Einen Vorteil erhält man dadurch nicht. Fractured Space lebt vor allem von der richtigen Einschätzung der Situation. Wer meint ein teures Schiff kaufen zu können und damit newbs wegzubocken, findet sich schneller auf dem Respawnscreen wieder als einem lieb sein mag.ES GIBT KEIN P2W in Fractured Space.TL:DRDownloaden und ein paar Tage spielen. Nicht von der steilen Lernkurve abschrecken lassen. Es lohnt sich! So etwas gibt es nämlich nicht noch einmal.',\n",
       " \"Only had this game for two days, but really enjoying it.  The tutorial does a very good job of leading you through the controls and how to play the game, and the 3 'starter' ships you begin with are no less capable than any of the other ships, they just have roles which make them easier to play (detection capable scout used in tutorial, a fast attack ship, and a support ship with healing AoE pulse and ability to break enemy armour).  All the ships in game are able to be obtained without spending real money, and the rate at which you can earn them seems pretty quick - there are multiple ships at relatively low cost, across a range of roles including a very tanky battleship, a medic ship with healing beams, a cloaky ambusher, etc.  The ships for the more complex roles will take a bit of time to work towards, but thats probably a good thing as it means by the time you can buy one, you've probably worked out how it could be used.\",\n",

       " 'Early Access ReviewA New Face for Early Access?When most people hear \"Early Access\" in a game\\'s description, what do they think? \"Shoddy, unfinished, unpolished, cash-grab.\"Fractured Space is an Early Access game, and without a doubt it blows those stereotypes out of the water (or would that be asteroid belt?)As an Early Access game, FS stands out with its beautifully polished content, but suffers from a lack thereof. What\\'s in the game (as of the time of writing) is phenomenal, but one can\\'t help shake the feeling that it\\'s an empty frame - beautifully crafted - waiting for something to fill the void.However, do not take this as a negative. The relatively small amount of content that exists in the game is still enough to keep a player occupied! Upgrade costs are balanced in such a way that players can look forward to tweaking their loadout with a new gimmick after every match, or hold out for a few more and get an entirely new ship.With a pace that shifts from relaxed to blistering at a moment\\'s notice, the game itself is stunning, breathtaking, and incredibly fun to play. There\\'s something magical about drifting in calm silence to let your ship repair one moment, then warping in to a hurricane of shrapnel and broadside fire the next. Fractured Space truly captures the mix of nerve-wracking tactics and frenetic action that real space combat would be - and wraps it up in an intuitive, easy-to-learn package.The assets are absolutely gorgeous and the atmosphere is incredibly well thought-out. Ship design seems to take cues from modern popular Sci-Fi as well as the classic Hard Science Fiction of the 20th century. The first time I clapped eyes on the game\\'s \"Flagship\" heavy cruiser, I felt the spirit of Robert A. Heinlein become one with my own and we both giggled uncontrollably for several minutes from sheer glee.Fans of War Thunder and other tactical vehicle-based team warfare games would be well-advised to pick this gem up ASAP.

The more points you capture the more resources you gain per second, and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage, giving you advantage over  the enemy ships. Currently you can choose between 15 or something ships (but this is still alpha, more ships to come for sure), you got  tanky ships, high damage ships, long range ships, close range attack ships, assasin ship (like you go in stealth mode, pop up next to enemy ship, do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there), support ships (repair yourself and allies, or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies.) and some mixed ships that have a little of everything.I can only say that i've liked this game so far, there are some downsides like laggy servers ( like 1 in 5 games for me are laggy, and 1 in 15 or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg), but that is what you get when you play alpha release. other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game (unless you alter some files) which is really anoying if you are one of the few people (belgium,france, ...) that use AZERTY keyboards, because the controls are for QWERTY which means you control the ships movement with ZQSD instead of WSAD. You can fix this by pressing alt+Lshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode, but than you will not be able to type properly.  All in all, great game, I am sure they will fix these problems in the near future, and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps  and modes to play.I rate it  7.5/10\",\n",

       " \"Early Access ReviewI picked up Fractured Space during the free weekend last week, and these are my thoughts after 3-4 days of playing it.Fractured Space is a very interesting and promising space combat game that combines A MOBA and World of Warships with a space age aesthetic. This game is relatively easy to get into, even for someone who generally dislikes MOBA's, such as I. The objective of each game is to capture the enemy base while vying for control of two lanes and a middle sector. You capture up to three mining stations to gain resources for your team. Resources are used to upgrade your ships, and the upgrade level of your fleet makes a huge difference in combating other players and capturing the enemy base. There is also the middle area, called the Gamma Sector. This is a large station that when captured by a team, gives the whole team a big damage buff, making pushes much easier to accomplish. Teamwork is a major part of this game, and this is made more obvious when you look at the variety of ships available. It almost reminds me of a class based shooter, like Team Fortress 2. You have your basic front line attack ships, the super massive defensive ships, and the support and healer ships. Any player can find a role and a ship that fits their play style the most. No ship is outright better then the other, which is a huge sigh of relief in a word of pay-2-win F2P games. Graphics are quite impressive in this game, though there are some minor rough spots here and there. The skyboxes are beautiful, distant planets look amazing, and the ships themselves are loaded with detail. The ships are the highlight of the audio-visual experience for me, looking like something a real company would make. They also sound great, weapons sound punchy and dangerous, and the warp drive really does sound how you'd imagine massive hyperspace engines would sound like. Though graphics can be a bit uneven in places, especially on asteroids. But as you're usually just flying by them, it won't bother you that much. There is also occasionally texture pop-in when warping into different lanes. But overall, graphics are sound are great.Gaining new ships and weapon in Fractured Space is a process of gaining experience in one of the three ship manufacturers in the game by using their ships, and making credits, which you gain after each round. It took me only a couple matches to unlock the first ship after the starter ship, and one more day to unlock the one after that. You can speed up the process by purchasing a microtransaction only currency and buying the ship with that, but you still need to unlock the ship with actual play time. And as no ship is a direct upgrade over the other, I find this very fair.Speaking of microtransactions, they are done very well in Fractured Space. The only exclusive things you can buy are ship skins and credit and XP boosters to use after the match, along with being able to purchase weapons and crew members (five stat boosters you can buy to improve your ship even more) faster. You can still buy these with credits, although it will take you longer. I think this system is totally fair and encourages people to invest in the game if they like it.My only real gripes with the game come from its Alpha, Early Access status. Matchmaking can sometimes not work, lag can playing borderline impossible, warping sometimes doesn't work, and general wonkiness and UI weirdness crops up. But all these things are being worked on by the devs, and the game isn't even in Beta yet. This game has a ton of potential, and I really hope that this game garners a large following in the very near future. Until then, I'll see you in the Gamma Sector while getting shot down by a Brawler.  \",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewWhile matchmaking is still being worked on, I can honestly say that the connection quality has shown some improvements, and I'm hopeful for the future. While it lacks the intense customization of games like DotA and LoL, it's current game format heavily resembles the balancing act that is involved with those games. Controlling stations gains you resources which level your team up, the more stations you control on the map, the faster you level, which in turn strengthens your teams ships. However, killing isn't the goal in this game, rather the capture of enemy forward bases to open the way for your team to capture their home base. Capturing stations will net you more resources, but also will signal to the enemy which sectors you're advancing on and where they should divert more ships to counter. There's a small series of tutorial missions that will enable you to get a sense of the basic mechanics of the game and how to move about, but it's up to you to get an idea of the tactics and strategy. There's currently three factions of ships, each with their own unique classes and abilities, so there's plenty of variety in the different ship classes, and there is also the chance to further tweak your ships through the uses of different crews and weapons. The game is slated to become Free-to-Play when it exits Early Access (may even be free now, not 100% sure) but, assuming there aren't any significant tweaks to the EXP and Credit rewards, the spectre of 'grind' doesn't seem to loom heavily as I've managed, as a rookie, to get around 1k of experience each game, making new ships availible every dozen games or so depending on my performance. Money will help unlock things faster, but the only things money can exclusively buy amount mostly to new skins for ships. It also helps that it scratches that capital ship itch. You know the one, the desire to maneuver a massive ship to bring an earth-shattering arsenal to bear on the enemy...\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewAbsolutely Great game with good graphics and fun combat... only downside (and what killed it for me) is that matchmaking is horrible, as I found myself grouped with teammates who didn't know what they should be doing, and enemy teams with 2000+ more matchmaking points than the team I was on, even being in a lobby with a friend (who is about the same level as me) did nothing to help.I'd love to see these things fixed, but untill they are, I sadly cant give this game more than a 6/10\",\n",

       " 'Im blown away by this game, the details of every ship is not something to be taken for granted, i usually have this sort of personal hate towards MOBA games because they usually turn out salty af, this game is not the case and i actually enjoy myself, its slow paced in a way but hey, those are huge ships.recommend it to anyone with a tactical view of playing games:)',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewI was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):My opinion: Solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. Only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad.  If played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. If you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. The devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game.  The negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. But really my negatives are limited to that and I do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions.  I suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards Sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. But when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. A lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. If anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so I find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. Additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. If i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what I see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. This isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. Of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect.  Since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.Microtransactions: Limited to skins essentially, you CAN'T simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. There is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. Every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewThis is a great game, one of the bests I've ever played. It gathers the best of the MOBA universe (the importance of positioning, map awareness, knowing how to push and where jumping across sectors) and the intensity of games as World of Tanks or World of Warships. The ships are really well designed and the variety of playstyles feels very nice. I totally recommend this game.\",\n",

       " 'Early Access ReviewI played this game quite a while back for a bit, believed it to be decent, but lacking. I have to say the game has come quite some ways, but it is still in need of more quality of life improvements.The good:*Good preformance running 3770K and 980.*Not grindy no stepping up of this ship is better they are simply different.*Gameplay flow is good, slow enough to be tactical and fast enough to be fun.*Ships truly are different and forfil different roles within the game and just just this is a healbot ship and this one does damage. They all have their prefered way of playing so once you are in you will find the ships that suit your playstyle. The bad:*Pricing feels high on the micro transaction they are boarderline macro in my opinion and this is not a problem unique to this game. *Lacks a quick communicate option like a command tree where you can with 2-3 button presses ask for support, order an attack etc etc etc. Such a system would be helpful in public matches and specially give new players and idea of what to do. *Bit more feedback on what just nuked you would be nice, sometimes you can really go from being just fine to death in seconds a bit of a what happened would be ideaal to help you learn, again quality of life. The ugly: *Match making is unsure of itself it feels, 1 match is very quick and the next one just will not show up. This makes it quite annoying to play because there is also no indication of why things take longer. So if there are very few players communicate this, that way it is still bad, but not frustrating.Overal I would recommend this game to those who like big space ships and moba style games as that is what it is a moba with capital space ships.',\n",

There is no tutorial but after a few matches you don't need one everything is kind of easy to learn. I honestly believe this game would be even more awesome if there was no pay wall.

It\\'s been a really enjoyable experience so far.  Game runs awesome, with zero problems on my rig.  (Intel i5 4670, 780 GTX SC, 8GB Ram).

I particuarly enjoyed the art direction on the ships as well as the lumbering manueverability during gameplay.  It really gives you a sense of the massiveness of the boats.  Lastly, I hope they keep skins as the only thing that costs money to avoid PTW.  Also particularly interesting is how the \"classes\" are essentially divided based on ship size, manueverability, and specific CDs.  What sets this apart is the 3-dimensional aspect of each engagement.Given that its still in Alpha, I\\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt on the following.1) Optimization2) Lag spikes in game3) Connectivity issue into matches4) No complete texture on most stationary objects.What I\\'d like to see more of, personally, are as follows:1) Larger teams, 5v5 seems too small... 10v10 sounds awesome, with bigger maps.2) A slighter further zoom on the ship3) Better effects on CQC type weapons4) More game modes5) More non-interactive background battles in some of these maps for immersion.6) More customization on loadout (Think MechWarrior Online)7) A grander conflict to engage community to work towards something other than just a grind.8) It be awesome if EVE was like this =)Will buy again for sure.

       " \"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe first thing that struck me about this game is that it's beautiful: detailed capital ships glint from the light of alien suns, back lit from the blue glow of an earth like planet or the red fire of a lava world with undulating rolls of magma oozing below: it's stunning.   The game itself feels like naval capital ship brawling from the age of sail, only in three dimensions and with rail-guns, guided missiles and the cold vacuum of space instead of the sea with fishes in it.   Rather than the more abstract controls of most RTS games, this game puts you directly in control of a capital ship using WASD (plus extra keys for vertical) and the mouse for aiming. The ships feel suitably massive and take time to turn. This adds a tactical element, using asteroids for cover as you try to blind-side the enemy. I really like the three dimensional aspect of this: feels like I'm battling Khan, hiding in the nebula.  The ships feel imposing and as their arsenal rains down fiery death from all angles, it gives a satisfying feeling of might.  There's an extensive range of ships to choose from, each with their own playstyle. They all capture the feeling of being in charge of a large capital ship, rather than a zippy fighter. There is, however, some variation in speed and agility: you can expect larger ships to be slower but heavier armored and more nimble craft to be weaker. There are no fighter craft to control; some ships launch waves of fighters or bombers but you don't control these directly.    The specialised abilities of the various ships (stealth, recon, close combat etc.) in game require team based game play in order to succeed: the focus is on multi player with the only single player play available being the tutorial. Personally, I'd like to see either a story mode or more bot based play in order to further explore the game before facing down live players.  Fractured Space is a new take on a team based shooter: the slower pace and larger scale lends itself to a more strategic and thoughtful play style, like home world but with direct control over your units.\",\n",

This game is one of those few games where a single player can\\'t tank everything in each match \"Team Cooperation is Key\" I\\'be been in team where everyone scattered and did everything on there own we lost in under 3 minutes on the other hand I played with a well oiled team and we won in under 3 minutes, and if both teams know what to do then I guess you\\'re gonna be in a 1 hour and 20 minute match GL.',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewIts a cool and good looking game with a good concept! I can see how some people will and do like it. But in my case its lacking action. Still its a good game and i recomend it or at least give it a try!',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewFun game, lots of spaceships, from what I can tell the premium ships they offer are not overpowered in any way over their existing free to unlock versions and all you get is a money + XP boost from owning it and using it in a game. The rest of the ships seem diverse and the game has a captain you get for your ship that is a talking cat named Jonesy which is a Alien movie reference in case anyone missed that. That being said, the game is still alpha, but is coming along and is playable. At the time of this review, the crew part of the menu is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed for me and my FPS takes a nose dive for no clear reason when I view the crew members in that menu and the only thing I can think of is because it is an alpha and they have not sorted out the bugs on it and probably not good optimization there yet.\"We are vunerable from down below, and that is never a good thing to say!\" -Elax Zenchas',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty great.  The gameplay is exciting, the graphics are impressive, and it is better with every patch/update.  The best way to give it a chance is to put at least a few hours into it.  I know that sounds outrageous, but seriously, play a handful of games using different ships.  Fractured Space is a really well put together game and the Devs are easily accesible.      The game has done nothing but increase in quality and a large player pool would be amazing.',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewFirst of all Holy crap the graphics are amazing. Secondly  the gameplay is easy to get into. Lastly it is an overal great game.I HIGHLY recommend this game if you love AWSOME games. One thing that is a problem is you need a decent graphics card towards the GTX 900s.',\n",
       " 'I sexually Identify as a Brawler. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the sectors dropping hot thumping loads on disgusting Colossi. People say to me that a person being a space craft is Impossible and I’m ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install side armor, Thumper cannons and Harpoon missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Ship” and respect my right to kill from close range and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a brawlophobe and need to check your spaceship privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.',\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewFractured space is a good idea but i do have some critisizms for the game1. when you leave the battle without ther game ending, there should be some reward not 0 Credis and 0 Ship Research points2. There should be a way to have a matchmaker create games based on your ship and not you choosing what game to joinPlease note that i did get the game while it was during the Free weekend where if you downloaded it then you got to keep that copyI persionally am neutral about this game (meaning i dont hate and i dont love the game)This is my review of Fractured Space-Nuclear Poptart',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewThe game is great but I'd like to tell you my opinion then give you a overall summary:- some of the ships look like they are covered in foil and are all glittery which is kinda wierd- not much in the way of upgrades and it's impossible to customize the ships in any way.- the crew members sound..... wierd.- I thought I would be able to actually command a fleet of ships like at least 20 at the same time in a game but I can only use 1 and dont get me wrong, it's fun but it's just knda... underwhelmingOverall, I would give this game  a 6 out of 10 mainly because customization and upgrading aren't great at the moment and would like to see ALOT more variety. And if they could add some more ships that would be even better.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewGood solid game at it's core, the Devs just need to fix the problems that have persisted for some time, such as ship tooltips not displaying correct information and the glaring issues with Crew creation (i.e. explain what the hell Crew skills do).  Not Pay2Win (yet) and it would be even better if they could get the ship mechanics right.  Matchmaking needs abit of work, half the time you'll find yourself as a novice playing with/against the top players on the leaderboards.  But the core gameplay is decent and enjoyable.  If you enjoy bashing your head on your keyboard after a match, or if you ever wanted to play World of Tanks but in LoL, this is the game for you.My one main issue: The Devs want $30 worth of Platinum to buy one Premium Ship that is exactly the same as the original ship, just reskinned with a pitiful (10%) exp/credit booster.  That's three times what the game cost at release. god damn ridiculous.  For $30 I expect a hell of a lot more than a new skin and dinky exp/cred boost.Spoiler! You WILL bash your head on your keyboard after a match on occasion  \",\n",
       " \"Ever since I downloaded the game I've been hooked. I started playing when the game went Free to Play. This is the space game that I have been waiting for. Commanding a ship against others is just so exciting and I can not get enough. This is indeed a new twist to the MOBA style of games. All killer no filler.I love this game so much that I'm about to buy some DLCs to help support the game\",\n",
       " \"Good Free-to-Play MOBA with nice space environment★★★★★★★☆☆☆Pros- Good solo mode, AI good enough- Huge number of ships- Very good possibilities for customizing crew- Seems to have a good difficulty balance- Nice graphics, smooth even on ultra specs- Nice sounds- Real Free-to-Play- Can't notice any bugCons- Poor music, especially in menus- Need to invest a huge amount of time to unlock features (or spend real money but that's not a must)- Can/will be quickly repetitive or very addictive (that's a MOBA!)This kind of game is usually not my favorite but I wanted to try the solo mode and wasn't disappointed. Graphics are really nice, crew specialties interesting and ship diversity is huge. Though you'll really need to spend a lot of time to unlock many of them. Not mentionning skins, extra weapons, specialties, etc. Or decide to unlock your real wallet...\",\n",
       " \"Hello friends! This game is one of my favorites. I've invested a ton of time into it and still play pretty much every night. Its a swirling melee of a game with plenty of depth to the combat with plenty of strategy and tactics to play with. So if you read no farther then know my opinion is: yes get it and start playing. This game is also 100% free to play! With absolutely no pay to win involved. Crew and ships as well as alternative load outs can all be purchased with in game earned credits (earned just by playing, which is why you are here right?) You can use money to speed things along, but mostly money gets you cosmetics. Some of which are really cool and lovingly made. And no ship is truely 'better' than all the others. The models and graphics in this game are georgous. It plays smoothly and is well optimized. It is still technically under development and so a lot of things have changed since i got here. But honestly it is amazingly polished. And at the time I am writing this things are in a great place. The balance is solid, with a few ships over preforming and a few under preforming. The thing that really sells this game for me isn't the team play (though I love that) or exciting combat but the unique way good piloting can turn a ship from average to unstoppable and how great tactics and strategy can make or break a team. I hope you pick this title up and love it the way I do. See you out there.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewIt's the epic ship to ship battles of the sci-fi genre you want with the customization options you didn't know you wanted.UPDATE:Games has drastically improved as developers add more and more things. Game now has dedicated tutorial and start-up guide for new players, so you don't feel like you're going in blind, gameplay has been smoothed out, and the game as a whole is generally more fun to play. It fulfills the dreams of large capital ship combat, and then some.\",\n",
       " 'Early Access ReviewPlayed this game for a couple of hours after getting it for free this weekend and overall I am saying it is a very good game, had 3 games in all upto now and not had a single problem in any of them. Very quick to get a game and once you know the controlles and warning sounds its a very fun game. ',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewI haven't been as activie since the last free weekend, but wow. Fractured space has come a long way. I'm impressed by the art improvements and new ship along with the way combat flows. Deveplment seems to progress at a steady speed with focus on gameplay vaule and new ship (class) types.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewI like this game, it's very complex and requires a lot of strategic thinking and teamworking, the only thing i find to be a minus is that i cant play it at more than 20 fps in the lowest settings, that might be my computer but if you have a system that can handle it I really recomend this game\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewIs it fun? Yes.Is it worth money? Depends.The game is an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game, with a tech tree similar to the likes of War Thunder or World of Tanks. However, it throws away the tiers, and instead balances all ships together into one matchmaking block, similar to Mechwarrior Online. It's enjoyable for a while, but the grind begins to get excessive. The good news is that you're not going to need to worry about repairs or ammo costs, which eliminates a point of stress in the grinding. The graphics are also absolutely beautiful. Unreal Engine 4 is put to the max, and boy does it look good. The ships also are interestingly designed.The game has two modes - a TDM style mode, and a capture the base mode. Both are enjoyable, but something like this could really use some more modes to keep its longevity. And now, onto the negatives. These modes won't keep your attention forever, and you'll quickly want more. The various classes of ships give a huge variety of playstyles, but again - you will be grinding a while to get a ship you may or may not like. UNLESS, of course, you decide to throw money at premium currency, in which case you can push to that ship faster, and this is a bit of a problem... unless you've snagged the game on a free-forever weekend, you've already tossed money at the game, and now they are asking for more money via microtransactions. This however, is only a temporary problem, since the game needn't be bought once it gets released.There also are major server issues, despite there only being a peak of about 1000 players online IN THE WORLD. Half the matches I'm in, I'll get severe lag stutters that are serverside, not on my end.Final thoughts - I'd suggest you DEFINITELY get the game on one if its free-forever weekends. It'll definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download. If you want to get the game with money, I'd also say it's probably worth it, especially with the steam refunds should you not like it. Will it be worth the microtransactions? You decide.\",\n",
       " '#NAME?',\n",
       " 'This is a great game honestly . Gameplay is amazing . Graphics are top of the line . Basically a Tower Defenese game in space. Make sure that you get Gamma when it goes Live and you win ... The thing that puzzles me about this game is the Community . Where is everyone at ? With as good and as much potentioal as this game has the player count is kinda low . Waiting to get into battles sometimes can take a few , but once you are in you are Golden',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewThis game is already good in Alpha, can't wait to see what the 1.0 looks like.  TOTALLY worth the $10.00!!  The gameplay and rules are simple, but the tactics and strats can get very complex.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewPersonally, I downloaded this a while ago. It was free weekend but unlike the usual situation with free weekend, I could keep this game FOREVER after downloading it. So of course, I downloaded and played it and to my surprise, it wasn't bad. Now, I haven't played this game for a while but I do have nice memories of playing with my buddies. A great team-based strategy game that allows the use of plenty of different tactics, whether you wanna soak up damage or sneak behind enemy lines and decimate the opposition, I'd recommend buying it.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewThis game is honestly a one to get. Since it's in the Alpha stage of development, there are some bug and optimization issues that need to be fixed. There's great graphics, a really great community, and teamwork is a MUST if you want to win. Pros:+Good graphics+Non-Toxic Community+Teamwork is a must+Very promising for future releasesCons:-Limited Servers-Not alot of people-NEEDS MORE PEOPLE-A bit of a grind to aquire new shipsOverall, I give it a 9/10Its a fun game to play, stress the meaning of teawork since theres only 5 players to a team. Great game to play with friends and work as a team to win. There's advantages that working as a team can accomplish, like ambushing the enemy, distractions, etc. This game is very promising for the future, and I strongly recommend that people get the game.\",\n",
       " 'It was such a fun game early on. I had an issue when I paid for an alpha game and then it went F2P.  Didnt play for quite a while. I went back today and the player base is gone.  Sad because it looks like the new co-op missions look awesome but didnt have the patience to wait for a game that long.  Its free, so go ahead and try it.  Maybe certain days have more players.  It really was fun...  I had way more than 9.8 hours, that must be after launch.',\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewA great game, beautiful graphics. A little bit of a steep learning curve, and some bugs in the proving grounds missions. But it's still a great game. hope they will fix the proving grounds bugs, so I can play again. Until then no Fractured space for me.\",\n",
       " \"Early Access ReviewReally cool game, especially as it's in an alpha state!+ Looks GORGEOUS, the ships remind me in style about Shattered Horizon [`]+ Fast-paced, focused gameplay+ Diverse ships and abilities, you can brawl on the frontline, debilitate your enemies or support your allies, it all depends on your ship choice- Not many players online. This game needs more promotion, and definitely more progress on the gameplay front\",\n",
